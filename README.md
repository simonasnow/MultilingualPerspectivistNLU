# Multilingual Perspectivist NLU

In this repository, we publish various results (linguistic resources, models, and codes) related to make _perspectivist_ the technologies of Natural Language Understanding.

For more information about the theoretical framework and available works on **perspectivism** see the manifesto page: https://pdai.info/ 

# Updates
- The EPICorpus (Frenda et al. 2023) is avalaible on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Multilingual-Perspectivist-NLU/EPIC 
- Released models are available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/Multilingual-Perspectivist-NLU/aggregatedModel 
- The MultiPICorpus (Casola, Frenda, Lo et al. 2024) is available on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Multilingual-Perspectivist-NLU/MultiPICo
- The folder code contains the scripts used for the experiments published in Casola et al. (2023) at EMNLP 2023
