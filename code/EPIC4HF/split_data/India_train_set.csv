fj5df9v,Totally got sucked down the rabbit hole on this.,"That Diana Ross and Smokey Robinson are Michael Jackson's actual parents. That's why he was the talent in the Jackson family and why there were rumors that he was Evan Ross's father (they both look like Diana). Smokey would've been 18 and Diana 14 years old when Michael was born so Berry Gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from Chicago, Joe Jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the Jackson 5. Joe had a big family where Michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and Motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.
It turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the Jackson 5 make it to Motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of Diana Ross in Gary, Indiana such as at the school talent show where the Jackson 5 performed. She has said multiple times on live television that Michael is her baby/child, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. She has also said publically she was in love with Smokey Robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in Detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. Diana also changed high schools around the time Michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). She was going to Cass-Tech to study home economics and Smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and Motown hadn't broke big yet. A decade later the Jackson 5 auditioned for Motown in Detroit, then did a second performance at a Motown get-together at Berry's house, and Michael has stated that at that point Diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.
There's a movie called Double Platinum which stars Diana Ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with Michael. Her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt Michael wore for Billie Jean at Motown 25. It's written by Michael in his autobiography Moonwalk that he and the Jacksons lived with Diana Ross in Hollywood Hills when the Jackson 5 first signed to Motown and moved to LA, and her and Michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. This would have been when Diana Ross revealed to Michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (This wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with Berry Gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) Smokey Robinson also stated when he was leaving the Larry King interview shortly after Michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of Michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and Bobby Taylor, who is said to have discovered the Jackson 5 even though their first album at Motown was presented by Diana Ross. 
This was also what Michael meant in the song Billie Jean when ""this happened much too soon, she called me to her room"". Diana was the one who said ""I am the one, but the kid is not my son"". She meant I am your mother but you're not my son, you're a Jackson now. Diana Ross is Billie Jean (Diana plays a character called Billie Holiday in 'Lady Sings the Blues' which came out a few years before 'The Wiz' with MJ). This is also what the song Dirty Diana is about, it's about Diana Ross the groupie who seduces Smokey Robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving Michael. Then there's the song Who Is It which is about a mystery person who abandoned Michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'Diana'. The song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' also talks about how ""if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby"" and again refers to the mystery Billie Jean character. He references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the song Leave Me Alone and says ""Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama"". He also references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the songs Baby Be Mine, Speechless, and Keep The Faith. This is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between Michael Jackson and Diana Ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.
Recently a video surfaced of Diana Ross singing You Are Not Alone to Katherine Jackson; just like how she probably used to sing Ain't No Mountain High Enough to Michael when he was living with her. This is seen in the aforementioned movie Double Platinum as well, Diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. And in TMZ's video ""The Last Time We Saw Joe Jackson"" an old senile Joe says ""I raised Michael, he's my son and Quincy Jones knows better. I don't talk about it, no way."" He's defending the supposed fact that Michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized ""he's a JACKSON"". After MJ's death, Joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile Smokey Robinson went on the Larry King show and praised MJ as an artist.
This theory explains why Michael not only looks like Diana Ross and has the same features and eyes as her, but also explains why his facial structure looks like Smokey's & their profiles and ears are completely identical, and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (Diana, Smokey & Michael are the only three musicians besides the Beatles who have two stars each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both Smokey and Diana (and Evan Ross!) have in common. Here you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like Ross eyes. Now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. It's why he acted like an orphan and called himself Peter Pan and built Neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. It absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. And it explains why Diana Ross is second to Katherine Jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why Joe Jackson has been known to dislike Diana Ross. At Michael Jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is Smokey Robinson reading a letter from Diana Ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that Michael was ""part of the fabric of her life"". When Smokey speaks about MJ later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. In the movie Hitsville USA: The Making of Motown, Berry Gordy jokes with Smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his & that MJ reminded him of a little Smokey. Also, the movie An American Dream was about the Jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. 
So, it wasn't that Michael was ever trying to look like Diana Ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he INHERITED from her. In one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. Now you might say well Janet looks a lot like MJ, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like Latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. Joe and Berry branded and marketed the Jacksons a certain way to make Michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to Michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). MJ has much more defined features and is rail thin like Diana Ross, and his nose & chin match Smokey's. Now it's clear why Joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.

>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

fj54o53,"Yeah, if it kicks off the chemists will  struggle with symptom relief and temperature control drugs.","I think we all need to hold our nerve. Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too. 
Prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. Batteries as well for LED lights and a radio. Pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches.",1

If you eat an actual portion of ice cream, that’s maybe like 120 calories which isn’t too bad. But if you eat the entire tub or a full bowl you’re in trouble. If you’re looking for casual snacks: veggies. I do celery with low calorie ranch, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, or carrots.

fj55344,"I live in Denver. I go to the airport a few times a year. For the past 2 years or so they have had the same construction stuff in the same places. They have these big walls to hide whatever they’re doing, with posters that are making fun of the airport conspiracy theory. Whenever I’m waiting in line at security I hear a banging sound that doesn’t sound like construction tools. It sounds like they’re just randomly banging on a metal pipe. I think a lot of the evidence is bullshit, like the murals and the runways being in the shape of a swastika, but it is a little fishy that the queen supposedly owns property near there. And the airport is really far away. I get that Stapleton Airport was too close to the city, but DIA is in what seems like Kansas.

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fj9hwgf,"It would seem the right mask to have personal reserves of ought protect in both directions. That is, protecting: the wearer; and others from the wearer.
So for example, if you have a form-fitting disposable P2/N95 mask with a valve this is not going to protect others from your exhalations (although, from personal experience, I've found valves great for bushfire smoke purposes).
It looks like, for example, the valveless https://www.bunnings.com.au/3m-p2-particulate-disposable-respirator-8210-2-pack_p0106620 fits the bill. Noting the explicit 3M™ Cupped Particulate Respirator 8210, P2

fjcbl8o,Well said.,"This is the Coalition's policy from the beginning, they obfuscate, blame others and then months after people care they finally admit the truth. This is for everything they do, all conservatives do it constantly.
Every problem caused by them is because of Labor, every bushfire is the Greens fault, every sports rort is a ""misunderstanding of the law and in no way corruption"", every coal-fired power plant an example of ""clean coal"", you halve a job and get two jobs for half the price, you get challenged by the media you don't like? They are lying we are telling the truth and their funding has been suspended. Every PM flung through a turntable? The Coalition is strong and some outdated anecdote about the Rudd vs Gilliard Years.
We have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. A sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. Yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a Liberal government. People who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? The government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or Labor and the Greens?
All these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. Yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! Vote for us more money! Vote for us more energy! And then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off. 
He should just resign, in fact they all should, if any of them had decency they would have tendered their resignations years ago but they won't because they want money and power and to be the elite special class while costing Australians billions and holding the economy hostage.

However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""

There is a little logic to this, but NOT when confronted by a pandemic! This is a new strain of virus which we have NOT been exposed to before, and we have NOT built up immunity towards. By not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
Not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. So you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. SO PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS!","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here.
Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!
Overall - Have an open attitude, meet people , talk to them and be safe!",0
