Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? What kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.","There are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 9/11. We can safely say the USA govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
The plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
All camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. Any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
The Air Force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 9/11 by Dick Cheney (The devil) himself 
Proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
The third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(I’ve been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. He’s no where to be found today.

Eromanga Sensei (the series this guy was most disgusted by) is a weird show though. Its casually pedophillic, but its also mostly just cute as heck. Its about an extremely prolific light novel author who's a teenager (for some reason in this universe, basically every successful author ever is a teenager), who writes under a pseudonym and gets his books illustrated by an artist he only knows through the internet called Eromanga Sensei. ES is assumed to be an adult dude, because he's known for his very erotic art. Turns out ES is actually... his little [step] sister (who's like 12), who he hasn't seen in over a year despite living in the same house because after their parents died she refused to come out of her room. And, other than the main siscon thing, its about her slowly coming out and becoming almost socially functional. If you can ignore the sex jokes and the marriage proposal and that the girl molests a few other people for ""artistic reference"", you can almost treat it like a totally wholesome show about social anxiety

fj5hpfp,"Sure, it ended up being the wrong decision. 
I work in operations and logistics, and I’m involved with accommodation and people living in close quarters. 
Keeping people on the ship was really the only decision that could’ve been made at the time. There would’ve been no scenario in which the government or any other organisation would’ve recommended removing everyone from the ship and placing them quarantine somewhere else. 
It looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority would’ve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of Japan and Asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. I know that sounds a bit morbid, but it’s accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
People also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that would’ve been a better choice. You’re talking about finding an isolated place, with thousands of individual rooms, already empty, ready to receive, feed, and treat thousands of people - all within a small enough distance from the ship as to not risk the public. It’s almost impossible at short notice.","Yes, the Japanese government really fucked that up. Locking everyone on the ship meant far more people caught it.",0

There is a little logic to this, but NOT when confronted by a pandemic! This is a new strain of virus which we have NOT been exposed to before, and we have NOT built up immunity towards. By not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
Not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. So you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. SO PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS!","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0

Further, there’s no real global standards for verified SMS which increases the likelihood of people being phished.

Its just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
In fairness both are reasonable rules.
The problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
Developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",Why don't banks accept your years worth of on time rent payments?!

Saw a program about top 100 books, where actors introducted a book/acted some of it out, and hitchhikers was presented by 
Sanjeev Bhaskar. He acted out some of stuff about the computer giving the ""42"" answer and I found it hilarious. Read the book, then the next one.......and the other 3 as well. Loved every single page of them.

fjcp7n1,That just looks scrumptious. I am surely gonna try it soon! Thank you for the recipe.,"Recipe for Fish:

Take a white fish and fillet it.
Brush the side with beaten eggs
Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:
Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.

It sounds mostly political. Kind of curious to hear from people who are with raffwu and whether they're more effective at getting workers what they want.","The SDA is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
>""The SDA is a tame cat union,"" says Paul Conway, secretary of left-wing Victorian meatworkers union. ""Its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the ACTU and ALP, getting its people into Parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
>https://www.smh.com.au/national/why-is-the-union-that-represents-supermarket-workers-stopping-gay-marriage-20150430-1mwl32.html
You might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""Otis Group"" group in labor. What you might have missed is that that group is predominantly SDA affiliated.
> What is perhaps most curious about the Otis Group, is the prominence of Members and Senators aligned to the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association—the Shoppies.
>Let’s go through the list: -
From the Senate:
>* Senator Ciccone: Shoppie.
* Senator Polley: Shoppie.
* Senator Kitching: an honorary Shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
* And, of course, The Godfather, Senator Farrell: Shoppie.
>From the House;
>* Daniel Mulino: Shoppie
* Nick Champion: Shoppie.
* Amanda Rishworth: Shoppie.
* Luke Gosling: Shoppie.
* And Anthony Byrne: a so-called ‘Mod’ which a new factional grouping that Guy Rundle
has described as ‘quantum-Shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously’.
>By my count, that’s basically half—of the pro-coal group of ALP parliamentarians
who are Shoppies.  And a number of these Shoppies are from places like South Australia, Northern Territory
and my home state of Tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
>How very curious. Not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - The Otis Group could easy be known as the New National Civic Council.
What on earth are those Labor members who have found themselves in the Parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
>https://youtu.be/vHIr1h_-qxc
Now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the SDA gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the SDA which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
>A partnership was formalised with the SDA in 1971 when six major retailers, including Coles and Woolies, signed landmark “closed shop” deals under which companies would sign up their staff as SDA members on the union’s behalf. 
>https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2016/shopped-out/
But it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. Nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
Which leads to things like this
>Coles workers have received pay rises of as much as $150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
>...
>In 2016, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
>More than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from Coles’ own expert showed.
>It took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that Fair Work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. That deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
>Nelio Da Silva, who has worked for more than five years at Coles, now gets paid an extra $140 a week under the new deal.
>He recently joined the new union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, whose secretary Josh Cullinan exposed the Coles deal in 2015.
>""'I was always after a union that represented me better,’’ Mr Da Silva said. ''They (SDA) are more conservative and that’s not me.''
>The SDA is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
>It is the largest affiliate of the ALP and has substantial political sway in Labor and the ACTU.
>An Age and SMH investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed SDA deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated $300 million a year.
>But despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
>Ms Ramnac had been suspicious of the SDA after her manager at McDonald’s pushed hard for her to join.
>''When I went to McDonald’s they really pushed for the SDA, obviously I joined because I was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
>''Soon I realised, on my own terms, they weren’t doing much. When you’re not accountable, not transparent, I can’t trust you.''

And I’m as Irish as you, bro. You don’t have to be Irish to be Irish. And you don’t have to be Irish to be Irish either. Nan and Pop were born and raised in Ireland and Dad always taught me I was Irish. The Irish never stop being Irish. Why do you think we march in those parades anyway?
EDIT: I’m leaving this here and you guys can downvote it to hell, like I give a shit. It’s not up to you if I’m Irish or not. I know I’m Irish and I’ve got the passport to prove it. If you have a problem with that, you gotta open your fucking eyes and stop being so goddamn judgemental. Fucking telling people they’re not Irish, shame on you.",1

fj9ycnm,"OK, so, assuming for some reason that we do get a major fucking outbreak with say 200-300,000  infected, people are going to have to be treated at home  while holed up in their rooms. 
Mild cases just need food, supplies and maybe money - middling cases should be treated by community nurses and a few doctors (freed up by the canceling of all elective procedures) who check in on them wearing a full set of NBC protection).  Their transport would be arranged by the army, who'd take charge of hosing them down between visits.   
The Civil Defense would be in charge of distributing supplies like anti-inflammatories and food, fresh water etc.
AGS would take care of civil order and all limits on overtime for all branches would be lifted. 
That's a broad-brush look at how we might tackle things, and while we're honestly not familiar with this type of regime and it'd be a very odd time I think on the whole Irish people would help pitch in and be helpful.","What do people think the worst case scenario is with COVID-19?

fj98ye4,"Yes I have seen many bhakts transform. They were just blindly following but some of them are very frustrated inside. They do understand Modis hypocrisy but are too afraid to admit because their own ego comes with it.
