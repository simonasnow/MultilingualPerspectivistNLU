Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",1

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.

(not condoning it) Cigarettes will kill you,  MGF, Regurgitator, powderfinger Recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, Pearl jam, yes spice girls lol. Superjesus was my first concert when I was 18 and living with friends in the late 90s. Livid festival.  I used to mosh! Holy crap lol. Mates I made.The balmy house parties in suburban Brisbane at uni. $1 drinks.  my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to Lions games with her. Jason Akimanis and Luke Power.
most of the 90s I was at school though. In dalby I remember the Great Locust Plague of 1994. And the mouse plague of '93. National anthem at school assembly. heartbreak High, Drazic, X files, and my friend and I used to make cheesy Mulder and Scully birthday cards. Jimeoin and Bobs cooking show. Aussie comedy. four weddings and a funeral. Listening to Lawsie on the radio with my dad on holidays. riding around town on my bike, dropping in on mates. art class. it was the only one I really liked I think, and English, drama. I remember backchatting teachers. Cross Country runs in 35 degree heat. Celing fans. Lynx deorderant. chatting with my best mate outside school for ages about Ab Fab. we gossipped about teachers like Mrs Brown 'how now brownnn cow' as we watched her drive off in her ""Toorak tractor"" we used to say. (its ok, bitchiness was deserved),internet got connected in my house when I was in grade 12, I thought it was the biggest deal to be able to chat to a rando across the world.  school camp at Tallebudgera where apparently everyone isn't scared of heights except me. a bat flying into our cabin. my friend screaming. bahaha. Electric blue streaks in my hair. (18) because I thought that was cool ha. qcs exams. excitement about moving out. the last week of school.  yearbooks and saying goodbye. two girls wore the same dress to the year 12 formal and it was awkward.  schoolies. sorry for the punctuation, good thread.",0

The usual was a set meal for 4.

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.

Hinduism has a lot more heterogeneity, and it is impossible to implement a cow belt version of Hindu doctrine across the length and breadth of the country.
