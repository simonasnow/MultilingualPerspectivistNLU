Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. 
So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.

It looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority would’ve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of Japan and Asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. I know that sounds a bit morbid, but it’s accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
People also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that would’ve been a better choice.

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

China actually has beds for more than 0.4%: 4.34 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.434%.

Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",1

We can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general. 
You'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. Protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible. 
I'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. I do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely. Then there's the huge percentage of people who simply can't afford to miss even one day without suffering financially. 
We really need a plan for this in the event that it becomes as serious as Italy. We have nothing to lose by preparing and containing.",0

fj7emio,"Up here in my pseudo-hillbilly corner of the Rockies, our Safeway has an entire cooler section just for the 1 gallon jugs of whole milk. It’s a staple of 90% of everybody I know’s fridge and unofficially, it’s our number one hangover cure, too. If a friend opens his door holding a gallon of milk, I know he’s in the middle of regretting the night before. My ex and I broke our refrigerators middle shelf because of the combined weight of his 2 gallons of 2% and my 2 gallons of whole milk that we bought weekly. (No, neither of us were or are obese. Lol)
I once laughed with a friend of mine at his Dad for offering his deck builders milk while they worked in 90°f (32.2°c) heat. 3 guys took him up on his offer, choosing it over Gatorade. 
In shop class in highschool, I built a 1/2 gallon milk container holder with a handle for my Nanna because she was struggling to lift them anymore.  Our local restaurants have giant milk chillers next to the waitresses soda stations. 
I dunno what part of the U.S. you’re from but milk is... MILK, here. Haha",From the U.S.  and I know no one that drinks milk.  Not one person.   A weird take sir.,1

Him and his wife got into a pretty heated argument in 2007, and she hasn’t been seen since. Lawyers hired by David claim she is still alive and devotes 100% of her time to work at the church of scientology, which is why she hasn’t been seen since August 2007. In 2013, a former member of the church had filed a missing person report that was closed after a few officers had “spoken and seen Mrs.Miscavige”, even though there’s no evidence whatsoever of this meeting. All missing person’s reports now are turned down since this investigation is forever closed.",0
fj7qbb7,"No prisoners are being released, Ghani Said.","Trump took whatever deal to cut bait in Afghanistan so he can campaign on it for re-election. Doesnt matter to him how it effects everyone else who has been part of this situation.
This will be terrible from India. A bunch of terrorists will be released. Now a decent amount of them will try to join the mainstream and seize power through the government. However there will be a large amount of brutes who are too radicalized or not competent enough to be part of the government. So what happens with them. Well alot of them will be recruited by the ISI for Kashmir. 
Remember the late 80s-90s when battled hardened jidahis rolled in from Afghanistan. Yeaaaah well the Modi government in their eternal wisdom gave Kashmir the middle finger at the worst possible time. Thankfully border crossings are much better controlled however we depended on a lot of information from locals to prevent terrorism and I just dont see them willing to cooperate",0

Looking at the list of countries affected, you will see that the rich and developed countries are at the top, and the poor and underdeveloped countries are reporting less than 10 cases. It almost looks like an Olympics medal tally table.

fj5uw51,"> Up the dole and other welfare payments if you want to do anything reactive.
Ha, funny joke.
This government will never do that sort of thing, it'll bring forward trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy before adjusting support payments in a positive direction.
I'm sure the government is aware that giving money to the 'lower class' will put money back into the economy and especially the retail sector but it'll never happen unless something huge happens to reshape internal LNP policies.
I expect to see more 'corporate socialism/welfare' before we get any sort of change that helps the 'little person'.","Nothing helps a national response better than further defunding the apparatus of state. /s
Up the dole and other welfare payments if you want to do anything reactive. They’re people who will be most impacted by economic issues (including people who may find themselves on it if this turns to a recessions) and by nature of necessity will be spent to circulate in the economy.",0
