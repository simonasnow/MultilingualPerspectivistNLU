fj54o53,"Yeah, if it kicks off the chemists will  struggle with symptom relief and temperature control drugs.","I think we all need to hold our nerve. Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too. 
Prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. Batteries as well for LED lights and a radio. Pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches.",0

The R0 of Covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth.

fj9ywus,"Interesting yes, it does have its merits for the kids alright","I work on ski resorts in the winter so maybe I can add to this conversation from a different perspective. Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

The outrage machine doesn't like it when anyone stops and thinks about why things happen. They just want you to be outraged, because then you are easily manipulated. Arndt wants people to think seriously about teen sexuality, not just pretend it doesn't exist, and about the reasons why men commit murder-suicide. It's not for the LOLs, and its not because All Men Are Evil.
When somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. It happens for a reason. The outrage machine doesn't want you to think about those reasons, so anyone who challenges the prevailing narrative must be silenced.

fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you’re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you’re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don’t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you’re dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It’s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There’s tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). You’re lucid!  But you’ll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization. 
So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
Think that’s about the basics. Don’t buy anything like masks.  They don’t work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.",0

fj78tne,"Pata nahi. Hindus have had the most appeasement - just think of beef ban. Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned. Rather than allow people to choose, it was banned for Hindu appeasement. 
So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win. 
RSS propaganda has really brainwashed Hindus tho. I'll give you a simple example. I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years.

fjci5nn,"I wish it did. 
It sounds mostly political. Kind of curious to hear from people who are with raffwu and whether they're more effective at getting workers what they want.","The SDA is a union run by social conservatives that exists to exert power within the labor party rather than do what is best for their members.
>""The SDA is a tame cat union,"" says Paul Conway, secretary of left-wing Victorian meatworkers union. ""Its primary interest is not its members but numbers in the ACTU and ALP, getting its people into Parliament, having an impact on issues like same-sex marriage.""
>https://www.smh.com.au/national/why-is-the-union-that-represents-supermarket-workers-stopping-gay-marriage-20150430-1mwl32.html
You might have seen recently in the news the pro coal ""Otis Group"" group in labor. What you might have missed is that that group is predominantly SDA affiliated.
> What is perhaps most curious about the Otis Group, is the prominence of Members and Senators aligned to the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association—the Shoppies.
>Let’s go through the list: -
From the Senate:
>* Senator Ciccone: Shoppie.
* Senator Polley: Shoppie.
* Senator Kitching: an honorary Shoppie by virtue of her factional prowess.
* And, of course, The Godfather, Senator Farrell: Shoppie.
>From the House;
>* Daniel Mulino: Shoppie
* Nick Champion: Shoppie.
* Amanda Rishworth: Shoppie.
* Luke Gosling: Shoppie.
* And Anthony Byrne: a so-called ‘Mod’ which a new factional grouping that Guy Rundle
has described as ‘quantum-Shoppies: existing in two factional states simultaneously’.
>By my count, that’s basically half—of the pro-coal group of ALP parliamentarians
who are Shoppies.  And a number of these Shoppies are from places like South Australia, Northern Territory
and my home state of Tasmania where the coal industry is either quite small or non-existent.
>How very curious. Not from coal mining unions; not from coal mining states; but with the numbers in a pro-coal
faction. - The Otis Group could easy be known as the New National Civic Council.
What on earth are those Labor members who have found themselves in the Parliament because
of their affiliation with a union that represents retail workers doing spruiking for coal?
>https://youtu.be/vHIr1h_-qxc
Now you might not care about internal labor politics but what it means is that the SDA gives sweetheart deals to companies as long as they help sign up new members for the SDA which gives them more clout inside the labor party.
>A partnership was formalised with the SDA in 1971 when six major retailers, including Coles and Woolies, signed landmark “closed shop” deals under which companies would sign up their staff as SDA members on the union’s behalf. 
>https://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2016/shopped-out/
But it generally means that they don't care about fighting for their members once they are signed up. Nobody wants to make enemies of big companies if they are trying to angle into a cushy parliament job.
Which leads to things like this
>Coles workers have received pay rises of as much as $150 a week after a substandard wages deal between the shop assistants union and supermarket giant was replaced.
>...
>In 2016, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission found that deal failed the ""better off overall test"", the legal test that workers have to be paid more than the award.
>More than half the workforce was underpaid, evidence from Coles’ own expert showed.
>It took nearly another two years of legal wrangling after that Fair Work ruling for a new agreement to take effect. That deal now largely reflects the minimum rates of the award.
>Nelio Da Silva, who has worked for more than five years at Coles, now gets paid an extra $140 a week under the new deal.
>He recently joined the new union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, whose secretary Josh Cullinan exposed the Coles deal in 2015.
>""'I was always after a union that represented me better,’’ Mr Da Silva said. ''They (SDA) are more conservative and that’s not me.''
>The SDA is well known for its conservative social positions whether on abortion, euthanasia and for many years on same sex marriage.
>It is the largest affiliate of the ALP and has substantial political sway in Labor and the ACTU.
>An Age and SMH investigation across 2015 and 2016 revealed SDA deals across fast food and retail left more than 250,000 workers paid less than the award and saved business at least an estimated $300 million a year.
>But despite that the fate of these workers has drawn little or no support from the broader union movement, even as unions have campaigned against penalty rate cuts, wage theft and flat wages.
>Ms Ramnac had been suspicious of the SDA after her manager at McDonald’s pushed hard for her to join.
>''When I went to McDonald’s they really pushed for the SDA, obviously I joined because I was a vulnerable young worker,'' she says.
>''Soon I realised, on my own terms, they weren’t doing much. When you’re not accountable, not transparent, I can’t trust you.''

It looks bad in hindsight, but the key priority would’ve been to minimise the spread of the virus among the greater population of Japan and Asia, not among the cruise ship passengers themselves. I know that sounds a bit morbid, but it’s accurate and they did mostly contain the virus to the ship itself. 
People also underestimate how hard it would have been to find any other accommodation or grounds that would’ve been a better choice.

fjbvtbu,"Fuck people like you man. This shit requires 20% of those infected to be hospitalized for 3 weeks and has neurological side effects. Also 20% of those hospitalized die due to ARDS. And these are just the official numbers, and I hear the actual numbers are much worse. Also, the virus survives on dry surfaces for upto 24 days in temperate zones and 9 days in warmer locations and it spreads through air as well after the saliva etc evaporates.
The problem therefore is two fold:


the stress on hospitals


the death rate


And in a country like India with bad healthcare already, and states like UP where gomutra is king, you can only imagine the havoc it will cause. I predict the government will not release the death rate numbers.","Not able to understand this frenzy. Sure it's 2 times more communicable than a flu, but it's a water borne disease.

The usual was a set meal for 4.

English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70).

None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.

fjcbl8o,Well said.,"This is the Coalition's policy from the beginning, they obfuscate, blame others and then months after people care they finally admit the truth. This is for everything they do, all conservatives do it constantly.
Every problem caused by them is because of Labor, every bushfire is the Greens fault, every sports rort is a ""misunderstanding of the law and in no way corruption"", every coal-fired power plant an example of ""clean coal"", you halve a job and get two jobs for half the price, you get challenged by the media you don't like? They are lying we are telling the truth and their funding has been suspended. Every PM flung through a turntable? The Coalition is strong and some outdated anecdote about the Rudd vs Gilliard Years.
We have a happy clapper running the country, a corrupt and abusive police officer with a major authoritarian chip on his shoulder in charge of our borders. A sycophantic banker in charge of the economy who couldn't give a toss about poor people, a ratty jobs minister who hid behind a whiteboard when asked the tough questions. Yet people still vote for them, people who never have benefited under a Liberal government. People who have been stuck on less and less wages, poorer welfare, limited access to childcare and healthcare and everything they value in their lives but who do they choose to direct their blame towards? The government that has ruined our country for close to a decade or Labor and the Greens?
All these men and women do is get into positions of power and lie constantly, get cushy jobs, have expensive holidays and then they turn around to the struggling people below them and rip up all their support networks and benefits while buying up more and more and more and more and never stopping. Yet people still take them at their word because of the carrot dangling in front of them, vote for us less tax! Vote for us more money! Vote for us more energy! And then they achieve none of it and everyone just accepts they were lied to 4 years ago and everything is different at the next election because it's a different shitty face and name to check off. 
He should just resign, in fact they all should, if any of them had decency they would have tendered their resignations years ago but they won't because they want money and power and to be the elite special class while costing Australians billions and holding the economy hostage. We have given them so much power and sway over us that it honestly doesn't seem to matter to a lot of people in this country that corruption has been accepted as normal and cool.

English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70).

All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance.

All it says is, acknowledging that some Hindus also lost their lives at the hands of Muslims doesn't discredit the fact that this was state sanctioned violence - a pogrom.","Everyone already knows about the states complicity in whatever is happening and has been happening. This isn’t a case of both sides. Hindu supremacists were voted into power, they introduced an anti-Muslim bill, Muslims in Delhi and other parts of the country protested, the centre sent mobs to indiscriminately kill Muslims, loot them, rape them and destroy their properties. Mosques were destroyed and they raised a Hanuman flag on top of a mosque. The police also took part in this. 
Then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against Muslim people? There is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. You’re looking at Kashmir, UP, Delhi.

>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to €1000 plus costs.
What is the reason code on your notice? 
If you appeal it right away it's frozen at the lower rate of €45 instead of going up to €100 (if not paid in 28 days) until the decision is made, so if nothing else this will allow you some time to get the money together.",0

Saw a program about top 100 books, where actors introducted a book/acted some of it out, and hitchhikers was presented by 
Sanjeev Bhaskar. He acted out some of stuff about the computer giving the ""42"" answer and I found it hilarious. Read the book, then the next one.......and the other 3 as well. Loved every single page of them. 
Since then, these books have spun me off into reading anything/everything I can get my hands on. So thank you Douglas Adams and Sanjeev for bringing this to my attention some 16+ years ago.",0

It looks like, for example, the valveless https://www.bunnings.com.au/3m-p2-particulate-disposable-respirator-8210-2-pack_p0106620 fits the bill. Noting the explicit 3M™ Cupped Particulate Respirator 8210, P2

Hospital tie-on face masks are designed to stop medical professionals infecting their patient [edit.. and protect the wearer from blood/fluid sprays].

These cuckoo funds are buying up properties for rent that would have been otherwise bought by private individuals. Where do you think they're living now?,">The non-household sector comprised a very diverse group of property buyers, including private companies, charities and State bodies, the report said.
Watch this be picked up by the ""ban the REITs and cuckoo funds"" people on one side and the ""why am I competing for housing with my tax money"" crowd on the other.
What will be missed is that the income requirements are only one element of affordability, high rents preventing people saving for a deposit is a huge problem. Reducing rents requires more rental stock. Getting more rental stock means a lower proportion of housing being sold to private buyers.",0

fjcp7n1,That just looks scrumptious. I am surely gonna try it soon! Thank you for the recipe.,"Recipe for Fish:

Take a white fish and fillet it.
Brush the side with beaten eggs
Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:
Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.

It seems to have become the norm now that unless your leg is falling off, you need to show up. It's fucking stupid, usually people are incredibly unproductive when that sick and they end up making a rake of other employees sick which in turn has a much bigger impact on productivity and company profits than if they had stayed at home in bed and properly recovered. 
We can't be calling in sick when we only have a dose of the sniffles or relatively minor ailments but some common sense from employees and bosses would go a long way to curbing the spread of this virus and the spread of seasonal flus in general. 
You'd hope that most large companies are developing action plans and counter measures at the moment. Protocols on what to do if members of staff are ill, asking people to go or to remain at home, encouraging employees who don't need to be physically present to work from home where possible. 
I'm mostly talking about standard, non customer facing office jobs here. I do understand for a lot of unfortunate people, this would be impractical due to a lack of sick pay allowance or the nature of their job means that it can't be done remotely.

Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out.

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",0

Having said that, I'd agree that spruce are horrible in most other ways and I'd love to see forests here planted with native trees.  If we planted more native trees we could make up for the fact that they sequester less carbon, and have some fantastic big forests.","Spruce trees do fuck all to soak up carbon. That's why their claim that they had planted hundreds of thousands of trees for the environment was bullshit.... it's just for logging. 
Native trees suck it in like a chain smoker. We need more of those.",0

fjbh624,Spotted the cow piss drinker ^,"Why has Reddit become so religiously biased. Every  religion has stuff that is practiced because guys wake the fuck up ... Religion is imagined more imagines and fiction than real.
It's hocus pocus done by a guy wearing fancy clothes. 
Stop taking the Koran literally, it's a book of wisdom not a Standard operation procedure because it was written for a different time. 
Stop taking the Bible very seriously, a lot if it was written way after Jesus was no more.
Manusmriti the hindu guidebook is ridiculous and makes for a good read to understand the wisdom of the time and that's that.
That being said religion is magic to those with faith. So when you make fun of one faith they retaliate and make fun of another. Hurt and pain begets hurt and pain. It's a bad cycle.

Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children. And who am I to say that you shan't have children? That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity – and the most tricky of all – is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",1
