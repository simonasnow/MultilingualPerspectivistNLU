The third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives.

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.

Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested...

There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",0

Eromanga Sensei (the series this guy was most disgusted by) is a weird show though. Its casually pedophillic, but its also mostly just cute as heck. Its about an extremely prolific light novel author who's a teenager (for some reason in this universe, basically every successful author ever is a teenager), who writes under a pseudonym and gets his books illustrated by an artist he only knows through the internet called Eromanga Sensei. ES is assumed to be an adult dude, because he's known for his very erotic art. Turns out ES is actually... his little [step] sister (who's like 12), who he hasn't seen in over a year despite living in the same house because after their parents died she refused to come out of her room. And, other than the main siscon thing, its about her slowly coming out and becoming almost socially functional.

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fj9hvdb,"Nobody gives a fuck about Irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. If your only argument for Ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. Just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the IRA as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
The only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic OPFOR for more than a few days, so why bother? A standing army in Ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men. 
&#x200B;
Do an Iceland and get rid of it all I'd say, keep a few tanks and guns around for the children and the re-eanctors to ooh and ah over.","A lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. We shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
First of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. They're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. They're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. That has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
Obviously Islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but Northern Ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in Europe. The defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. They were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the IRA to set up on our side of the border.
Also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
They also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
And lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. Ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. The value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
These are all essential services that we all take for granted. However, with expenditure at 0.3% of GDP, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. Members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. With extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
We can still have among the lowest expenditure in the EU and increase funding to ease all of these problems.",1

Its just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
In fairness both are reasonable rules.
The problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
Developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",Why don't banks accept your years worth of on time rent payments?!

Muslims will continue to be killed and hunted
NRC and CAA will be applied without obstruction
Most Muslims will move to other countries as migrants
Yogi will become PM in '24
The Muslims still in the country will be killed and raped by sanghis
India will become a Hindu nation (duh it already is)
Then people will start to get divided by caste
The Hindu nation will realize that they should've paid attention to major issues like economy and shit before because now it's irreparable
This country where the police, the courts and the lawmakers are sold for prices, how can you expect justice even when everyone is the same religion
The country will fall into the trap of rich gets richer poor gets poorer
India will turn into Syria and RSS will be termed a terrorist organization like ISIS
'Virat Hindus' today will finally get what they always wanted

fjciuic,Bus driver sounds like he was on a power trip.,"Aside from tourists sitting in the priority season and ignoring me standing with a nine months pregnant belly, or the bus on New Year's with a bunch of young kids drinking who then started shouting ""Let us off! Emergency!"" while one of the boys vomited all over the bus floor, here's my favorite.
About a month ago I was leaving the GP with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so I had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. I get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". He won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am I supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""
If I could have held my screaming baba up to that man's ear like a seashell, I would have. I get that rules are rules, but it was kind of ridiculous.",1
