fj9i0a2,"Wanna see a statesman, look no further than Angela Merkel. No wonder she did not shake hands with Modi. Modi does Mann ki Baat. Hindustan mein ek hi insaan ke paas mann hai. Baki sab to chutiye hain. Modi's problem is his bloated ego. That's what made him wave at no one in Dal Lake and use his raw wisdom in inventing new radar technologies. At the same time, he is a thorough coward. He does not want to face people. He does not want to face questions. He lives in his echo chamber of his flatterers and occasionally caters to modia.
I find Modi to be a very insecure person, scared, vengeful, delusional to an extent. He has another side though, which he presents to his audience,.. Brash, resolute, ambitious, flamboyant, dragon-slaying savior of people image. It is a projection. Such a projection would attract most people. He is a populist.

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
Instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great Shia La Beouf; “just do it!”",0

Such a cheap and easily available source of high protein nutrition is everywhere in India - a country so high on malnutition, yet it is banned.

So much government money is spent on Hindu festivals and subsidizing hindu pilgrimage (4500 cr) while the Hajj subsidy (200 cr) which actually was a disgusting lie of a subsidy was much maligned. The Hajj subsidy never helped Muslims, do you know that? Since Air India had the monopoly on the gulf routes, it would rise the price of each ticket to mecca by 20k and then request the government to subsidize that 20k. The Muslims pilgrim would pay the same amount as before, but Air India would get 20k per ticket from the government and Hindus would get to shit on Muslims. Win-Win.

I recently learnt that lotus is not the national flower of India (an RTI was raised and the government confirmed that there is no national flower) but every Indian I know fought with me about it being the national flower. RSS grip on the government is so tight even when BJP is not in power, that the flower representing the birth of Hindu god Brahma of hindu iconography, which is also the party symbol of BJP was falsely called the national flower to such an extent that it is considered truth. It is the same RSS that has taught Hindus to hate Muslim kings for destroying temples when the total count of temples (quotes as hundreds of thousands) is less than 100 while the total count of temples destroyed by hindu kings is a little under 1000. 
RSS has been hard at work spreading lies exaggerating the accomplishments of their own leaders and belittling the good rule of Muslim rulers. We are all victim to their propaganda - not just you or just hindus.","Muslims have got the benefit of appeasement politics for many years. It is one of the major reasons why Hindus are angry towards the community.

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Paul Cullen Health Editor
Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

I am equally dumbfounded that the Liberal government would consider such a bill and that the Labor party would agreed to support the governments bill when it appears such an obvious move to vote it down with the cross bench.

fj7lzl7,"I used to go every year to Hockenheim. Had my fixed ticket in the Südtribüne, awesome seats. Favourite memory was Irvine winning and Jordan coming third in 99. Brilliant weekends mixing with great fans from all over. Once it went behind a paywall I lost interest totally, stopped going as I no longer watched. Couldn't even tell you the teams in F1 now outside the old regulars.
I really hope the same doesn't happen to the rugby now.","Such a short term outlook by the governing bodies. The sport gets so much more exposure and interest (and new fans) by being on free to air, terrestrial TV. Cricket hemorrhaged fans when it went from Channel 4 to Sky years ago, same with Formula 1.",0

fj5x1nc,Agree to most of it. Except it won't be syria because of business tycoons who have all invested here heavily. May be something like Saudi Arabia that moves according to their religious laws and morals. No way I see a Syria here. Atleast the government has to maintain some level of image to get avoided from sanctions etc. Anyway I don't expect a Syria like situation.,"Also, this country is dead. No fucking doubt it is GONE. No reviving from this. here's what's gonna happen in the next few years:-

Muslims will continue to be killed and hunted
NRC and CAA will be applied without obstruction
Most Muslims will move to other countries as migrants
Yogi will become PM in '24
The Muslims still in the country will be killed and raped by sanghis
India will become a Hindu nation (duh it already is)
Then people will start to get divided by caste
The Hindu nation will realize that they should've paid attention to major issues like economy and shit before because now it's irreparable
This country where the police, the courts and the lawmakers are sold for prices, how can you expect justice even when everyone is the same religion
The country will fall into the trap of rich gets richer poor gets poorer
India will turn into Syria and RSS will be termed a terrorist organization like ISIS
'Virat Hindus' today will finally get what they always wanted

Maybe 5 years maybe 10 years or maybe 15 years down the line, one day, people will realize that they never wanted this. Even the sanghis will sit down and think ""Is this what I wanted?""
Sit and think. Sit, and think.",0
fj9hwgf,"It would seem the right mask to have personal reserves of ought protect in both directions. That is, protecting: the wearer; and others from the wearer.
So for example, if you have a form-fitting disposable P2/N95 mask with a valve this is not going to protect others from your exhalations (although, from personal experience, I've found valves great for bushfire smoke purposes).
It looks like, for example, the valveless https://www.bunnings.com.au/3m-p2-particulate-disposable-respirator-8210-2-pack_p0106620 fits the bill. Noting the explicit 3M™ Cupped Particulate Respirator 8210, P2
> 8210 can also be used in certain applications against some bio-aerosols. such as, influenza virus
Happy to have your expertise bear on any of that.","The ridiculous thing is if they are the flat tie on kind they don't protect the wearer so they are useless for people to steal. Hospital tie-on face masks are designed to stop medical professionals infecting their patient [edit.. and protect the wearer from blood/fluid sprays]. Only the form-fitting P2/N95 rated type protects the wearer [from inhaling particles/viruses].
Edit: source: I have spent many years doing filter/respirator R&D. Some of my papers are cited by 3M (a leading respirator and surgical mask manufacturer) in their technical manuals",1

fj8g9uv,"I feel like if I'm getting blackout drunk, I'm going to be checking what I've spent money on. I guess she may have paid in cash though.","I had a pal who often went out drinking on a Friday. She told me she’d spotted a new Chinese takeaway that had opened in the last couple of months, and planned to stop in and pick up some drunk food.
When she arrived, the staff greeted her by name and asked if she wanted the usual. She had no recollection of ever having been there but curiosity got the better and said yes please.
The usual was a set meal for 4. 
She had never had leftovers or even containers at her house, and her husband said she’d never come home with any Chinese, so the only logical conclusion is that she sat on a bench and ate a 4-man Chinese drunk and alone before returning home, on more than one occasion.",0

Going for a walk now and will have to do a bit of study later on - have an exam Tuesday, keep the fingers crossed for me. Hopefully it'll be grand :)
Off to South Africa for a holiday with herself then on Wednesday - really excited, haven't had two weeks off work in a row since 2016 and very much looking forward to it!
Life is all good at present! Hope ye are all keeping well.",0
