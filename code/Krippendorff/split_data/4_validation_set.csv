All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them.

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.

No reviving from this. here's what's gonna happen in the next few years:-

Muslims will continue to be killed and hunted
NRC and CAA will be applied without obstruction
Most Muslims will move to other countries as migrants
Yogi will become PM in '24
The Muslims still in the country will be killed and raped by sanghis
India will become a Hindu nation (duh it already is)
Then people will start to get divided by caste
The Hindu nation will realize that they should've paid attention to major issues like economy and shit before because now it's irreparable
This country where the police, the courts and the lawmakers are sold for prices, how can you expect justice even when everyone is the same religion
The country will fall into the trap of rich gets richer poor gets poorer
India will turn into Syria and RSS will be termed a terrorist organization like ISIS
'Virat Hindus' today will finally get what they always wanted

Maybe 5 years maybe 10 years or maybe 15 years down the line, one day, people will realize that they never wanted this. Even the sanghis will sit down and think ""Is this what I wanted?""

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Paul Cullen Health Editor
Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

It's not for the LOLs, and its not because All Men Are Evil.
When somebody, man or woman, kills there own children and then themselves, it's not just a random act of evil. It happens for a reason. The outrage machine doesn't want you to think about those reasons, so anyone who challenges the prevailing narrative must be silenced.

fj924zz,So a cost-benefit analysis actually favours something the liberals have done?,read the article!  This place smashed out 80000 cups a year. Expected to boost sales by 20000 cups. Will pay for itself within a year! This is a good investment.,1

There is a little passage In law to do with use of force and more specific preemptive strikes etc that is something along the lines of, “ special consideration should be taken around the prosecution of security staff at licensed premises due to the nature of their role and frequent contact with conflict” 
Sure many door staff will agree that consideration is pretty slim sometimes and a genuine concern that I’ve seen people post/ mention is that you can be in a full physical fight with someone that wants to do you harm and you have no idea how much support you will get from a legal perspective. 
You know that if someone complains it’s entirely someone is gonna sit there for hours picking the cctv apart frame by frame with some paper noting every moment of physical contact you make and try to decide from their office chair if they felt it reasonable.","Well enjoyed this !

The stupid priest want to create a connection between the cooking and the periods. Periods are OK. Cooking is ok. The portrayal of connection is bad.

fj8tzto,">  Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
Tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. Oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",0
fj7pbfi,Yes it's inexpensive but IMO it's overpriced for what it is. The price of the mediocre sausage rolls is shocking.,Opposite of overpriced. Entire draw of it is how cheap it is. Use the change at the bottom of my pocket that never gets used for anything else.,0
fj8d9y3,"Interestingly, Latin forms a past tense very similarly: locutus est = he is having spoken = he spoke. Irish also does it (táim tar éis ...) but I don't know whether the Hiberno-English comes from the Irish or vice versa.",Using the word 'after' to signify the past tense.,0
fj9a1iu,"And they also imported food in one of the first major attempts to stop a famine. 
Peasants starving was not something 19th century regimes normally cared about, be it any of the famines in Ireland or Britain, or anywhere across Europe. 
Some of your points don't really make sense either. The British used sepoys in India, they never had huge numbers of British troops stationed there because it was really far away. 
Also, who do you think was exporting all this food? Do you not realise it was mostly Irish people?","Food exports out of Ireland was so important that they stationed more British born troops in Ireland than they had in India. Plus they got the then pope to issue the threat of excommunication from the alters of Ireland on anyone interfering with the export of food. 
The RCC only responded to the starvation crisis when they saw Baptist evangelism elbowing in. Otherwise millions starving was not a concern to them.",0

I think it's a great idea in this modern age.  We could use the results and data to focus funding on improving quality of life for people instead of just looking at the books.
