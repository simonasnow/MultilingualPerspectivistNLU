fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you’re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you’re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don’t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you’re dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It’s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There’s tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). You’re lucid!  But you’ll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization. 
So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
Think that’s about the basics. Don’t buy anything like masks.  They don’t work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.",0

Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too.

Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio.

fj9bdej,They are testing and they are isolating just not publicly announcing this.,"Just started watching Dr. John Campbell’s videos on YouTube, he’s a no bs approach to this ordeal and just telling the facts as we know so far. Just put out a video of global isolation and containment where he spoke about a paper in The Lancet. How to best control the outbreak by isolation of cases and isolation of the contacts of said cases. The R0 of Covid-19 is 2.6, meaning for every case, that person will infect 2.6 and so and so forth. 
So basically the paper is saying the only way to contain this is to slow the process as much as possible and completely isolate cases and contacts. Imo we’ve already fucked it with the way we’ve handled our first case. In a small country like ours it should be easier to contain but if not acted upon properly it can spread faster. I think we are gonna be at Italy levels in the coming weeks.
I’m not trying to fear monger because the majority of us should be fine but it’s so frustrating to see it not taken seriously by people. Look at Vietnam and how they have handled it, looks like they have stamped it out fast and actually took serious measures to stop it spreading from the get go.",0
fj9dnt0,"No shame in going to therapy for a few sessions. 
I’ve done it myself times when everything seemed fine, and after some trauma. Turned out to be immensely useful for both periods.","Here lad. I've had a look through your post history, lots of posts about wanting to die. You need to get yourself some help.

fj9ot8u,"Although I don't think it's acceptable to take someone else's milk which they're paid for, I don't know if this would technically be considered a crime. It's left outside their property and not secured in any way. I say this because I know someone who just had their bike ""nicked"", but they left it unlocked outside a premises and expected it would still be there. I work with drug addicts and they will literally take anything they can get their hands on. It's sad but seeing someone take milk that's left outside doesn't surprise me in the slightest.","I know it seems like a naff thing to report, but reporting this to the police and sending them the footage could help if she’s a repeat offender at loads of properties and ever gets nicked.",0

fja3l7b,Chinese McDonald's >> any McDonald's elsewhere. Especially their fried chicken steak and the grilled chicken burger (坂烧鸡腿堡) is amazing and only sold within China.,"I've done a similar thing.
I live in China and McDonald's deliver 24/7, but at the time, after 10pm they only do a limited menu, and you have to buy whole meals.
Well a few of us drunkenly went back to a friend's at about 2am, all hungry, one guy wanted two Big Macs but nothing else, someone else wanted a double cheese burger and nuggets and I wanted nuggets and chicken wings, plus god knows what else 
I explained its meals only and everyone was alright with that, and then the guy turned up and we must be have about 8 large cokes and fries and then all these burgers and nuggets and chicken wings.
Next day I guess the guy woke up forgetting what we'd done as we all got texts asking when the fuck did he open a McDonald's franchise
Good times.",0
fjbh624,Spotted the cow piss drinker ^,"Why has Reddit become so religiously biased. Every  religion has stuff that is practiced because guys wake the fuck up ... Religion is imagined more imagines and fiction than real.
It's hocus pocus done by a guy wearing fancy clothes. 
Stop taking the Koran literally, it's a book of wisdom not a Standard operation procedure because it was written for a different time. 
Stop taking the Bible very seriously, a lot if it was written way after Jesus was no more.
Manusmriti the hindu guidebook is ridiculous and makes for a good read to understand the wisdom of the time and that's that.
That being said religion is magic to those with faith. So when you make fun of one faith they retaliate and make fun of another. Hurt and pain begets hurt and pain. It's a bad cycle.
So dear reddit stop saying religiously inflammatory shit for any religion. 
I know I am guilty just the same and hope that my realisation transcends in you too.",0
fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",1
fjcife5,"It wouldn’t take much for already limited resources to become overwhelmed. But the HSE have been getting prepared for this and the infectious disease units are ready and waiting for serious cases.

fj9xbv9,That classic smirk everyone gave each other when someone was made to sit on the pissy sofa xD,"We used to throw quite a few parties at my old uni place. People would just pass out where and as they pleased.
Woke up to one of our mates standing in our living room, obviously sleep walking - he was pissing directly onto our sofa. We shouted at him, no response. So my housemate punched him, which woke him and stopped him pissing.
We explained to him what he was doing, he apologised, went back to sleep and got up in the morning to clean the piss off my sofa. Fortunately it was a leather sofa, but it was still a bit pissy so we just made people we didn't like sit on it.",1
fjc3mzk,"Nah, I’m making it about parliamentary and judicial sovereignty, not the monarchy. The Queen can stay in England and have fuck all to do with Australia, thanks.
Australia is a de facto republic anyway (‘commonwealth’ is actually a synonym for ‘republic’) and while I’d like to become a real republic, I reckon the Australia Acts are way more constitutionally important to us as a sovereign country than the arrival of the first fleet.","You are still making ""Australia Day"" about the British monarchy so I don't think changing the date to today is going to fly with the people protesting about the current date... of course I don't think any date is going to suit them.",1

fj9evy7,We have legislation permitting a safe injection facility on the cards for the last 5 years. It's been blocked multiple times from planning permission objections.

One day we'll hopefully have a place like this for drug users to go and access harm reduction facilities.,"Watched a documentary (think it was in Canada) a while back where they had safe centers where people could get clean needles, be supervised by medical staff while using controlled substances and offered rehabilitation programmes and not be threatened by police 
None of the drugs had been decriminalised but the state has recognised an epidemic and offered a safer system to those at the highest risk levels.
I don't think at this point decriminalization would do shit. we've an rooted black market supply chain that isn't going anywhere, best thing the state can do is provide early education into the long term effects of drug use, heavily change the support infrastructure for those caught in addiction cycles and stop treating em like dregs and leaving em in back alleys.",0

Given the inherent networking nature of these events, you may we well stick down pronouns along with your name. Literally no reason not to, and to be annoyed by that is stupid.

fjdoskx,"A partner is far more likely to be infected - because of things like kissing. But siblings/parents etc are less because not kissing. But obviously they are definitely at risk because living in close quarters is known to spread things like this - look at norovirus. 
I would say the whole idea of not quarantining the families unless the exposed is showing symptoms is because if theyre not showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing etc) theyre probably not spreading it very far. You have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. Will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.","If a family member becomes infected and self isolated, isn’t it too late for the rest of the family at that stage?

Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here.
Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!
