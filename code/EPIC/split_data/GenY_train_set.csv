Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant.

>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Nobody noticed any fallacies? And why would the government destroy a major financial asset, what motivation do you think they would have for that? The thing about your argument is that it makes no logical sense what so ever, and I guarantee that the person who kamikazed into a building wasn't found perfectly fine afterwards, and the plane crashing into the building looks doctored? What kind of bs is that, you can analyze the footage yourself, or maybe ask a professional to look at it and see it definitely isn't doctored.","There are way too many iffy occurrences before, during, and after 9/11. We can safely say the USA govt were incompetent in its prevention at least, and had a knowing hand in it at worse. 
The plane crashing into the towers appears to be doctored. 
All camera footage of the area was confiscated by the govt. Any footage you see online is state sponsored. 
The Air Force bases were ordered to run airline hijacking drills the morning of 9/11 by Dick Cheney (The devil) himself 
Proof that it was a controlled demolition was melted down and erased. 
The third tower, obviously, came down as a result of explosives. 
(I’ve been saving the biggest for last) - one of the alleged pilots of that flew into the towers was found alive and well shortly after and had nothing to do with the events. He’s no where to be found today. 
I hope no one believes in conspiracy theories. They’re just unanswered questions with not enough data to reach a conclusion. 
The troubling thing is, when the data you need comes from the source you suspect of wrong doing then you can either take their word for it, or not trust the data.",0

fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you’re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you’re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don’t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you’re dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It’s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There’s tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). You’re lucid!  But you’ll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization. 
So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
Think that’s about the basics. Don’t buy anything like masks.  They don’t work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.",0

Whenever I’m waiting in line at security I hear a banging sound that doesn’t sound like construction tools. It sounds like they’re just randomly banging on a metal pipe. I think a lot of the evidence is bullshit, like the murals and the runways being in the shape of a swastika, but it is a little fishy that the queen supposedly owns property near there.

fjcp7n1,That just looks scrumptious. I am surely gonna try it soon! Thank you for the recipe.,"Recipe for Fish:

Take a white fish and fillet it.
Brush the side with beaten eggs
Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
place fried fish
use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:
Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
peel off any remaining skin
pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.

Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!

Emergency!"" while one of the boys vomited all over the bus floor, here's my favorite.
About a month ago I was leaving the GP with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so I had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. I get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". He won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am I supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0

Thank you for the travel warning.,"They could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
I think for pest species it's the German cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. Even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
If you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast US and you'll see some shit all right. I once spotted one in the kitchen in the house I grew up in down in Florida because I was in the sitting room watching TV and I heard it walking around. I dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when I got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
Oh, and did I mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly?

Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.

He will be cracking one out to coronavirus
I couldn't give the tiniest shit how well he narrates nature documentaries
He is fucking evil
Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children. And who am I to say that you shan't have children? That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity – and the most tricky of all – is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",0
fj9gi9o,"Speaking of containment - this virus has been circulating in China for about 3 months or so.  China has a population of 1.38 billion.  So far, about 80,000 have contracted the virus and just under 3,000 have died.  For a country with such a massive population and lots of very densely populated cities, I'd say that's pretty good containment so far.","We will be lucky if we aren't at 20+ cases by the end of the week. Containment has worked so far, but the current sufferer was out and about for a few days while sick so will need lady luck on our side for numbers to stay down.
Hopfully further spread is limited and / or slow.",0

The consulate will be nothing more than a phone number and a part time receptionist and given Barundi's importance and relevance, I doubt there will be much for them to do.","This is literally just click bait, I mean look at that title, its an article just to make people angry.
I mean, we have embassy's of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan ect, all of which execute people for being gay. Why are we not outraged at them? Many, many other countries also imprison gays and we still have ties with them. What about countries accused of war crimes and genocide?

It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",0

Saw a program about top 100 books, where actors introducted a book/acted some of it out, and hitchhikers was presented by 
Sanjeev Bhaskar. He acted out some of stuff about the computer giving the ""42"" answer and I found it hilarious. Read the book, then the next one.......and the other 3 as well. Loved every single page of them.
