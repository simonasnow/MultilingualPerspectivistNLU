Whenever I’m waiting in line at security I hear a banging sound that doesn’t sound like construction tools. It sounds like they’re just randomly banging on a metal pipe. I think a lot of the evidence is bullshit, like the murals and the runways being in the shape of a swastika, but it is a little fishy that the queen supposedly owns property near there.

>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too. 
Prepare for possible power outages, the same way we did for the bushfires. Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio. Batteries as well for LED lights and a radio. Pillar candles or tea lights as a back up and some matches.",0

I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city.

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril.

Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open...
