No reviving from this. here's what's gonna happen in the next few years:-

Muslims will continue to be killed and hunted
NRC and CAA will be applied without obstruction
Most Muslims will move to other countries as migrants
Yogi will become PM in '24
The Muslims still in the country will be killed and raped by sanghis
India will become a Hindu nation (duh it already is)
Then people will start to get divided by caste
The Hindu nation will realize that they should've paid attention to major issues like economy and shit before because now it's irreparable
This country where the police, the courts and the lawmakers are sold for prices, how can you expect justice even when everyone is the same religion
The country will fall into the trap of rich gets richer poor gets poorer
India will turn into Syria and RSS will be termed a terrorist organization like ISIS
'Virat Hindus' today will finally get what they always wanted

Maybe 5 years maybe 10 years or maybe 15 years down the line, one day, people will realize that they never wanted this. Even the sanghis will sit down and think ""Is this what I wanted?""

fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you‚Äôre dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you‚Äôre dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don‚Äôt work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you‚Äôre dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It‚Äôs a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There‚Äôs tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). You‚Äôre lucid!  But you‚Äôll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization. 
So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
Think that‚Äôs about the basics. Don‚Äôt buy anything like masks.  They don‚Äôt work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.",0,reddit

fj9ywus,"Interesting yes, it does have its merits for the kids alright","I work on ski resorts in the winter so maybe I can add to this conversation from a different perspective. Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

fj9i0a2,"Wanna see a statesman, look no further than Angela Merkel. No wonder she did not shake hands with Modi. Modi does Mann ki Baat. Hindustan mein ek hi insaan ke paas mann hai. Baki sab to chutiye hain. Modi's problem is his bloated ego. That's what made him wave at no one in Dal Lake and use his raw wisdom in inventing new radar technologies. At the same time, he is a thorough coward. He does not want to face people. He does not want to face questions. He lives in his echo chamber of his flatterers and occasionally caters to modia.
I find Modi to be a very insecure person, scared, vengeful, delusional to an extent. He has another side though, which he presents to his audience,.. Brash, resolute, ambitious, flamboyant, dragon-slaying savior of people image. It is a projection. Such a projection would attract most people. He is a populist. One needs to though focus on what he does not do or does not say. That tells about the real Narendra Modi.",Zero press conference in 6 years. Much statesman. smh,0,reddit

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject.

It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one‚Äôs own peril.

Mild cases just need food, supplies and maybe money - middling cases should be treated by community nurses and a few doctors (freed up by the canceling of all elective procedures) who check in on them wearing a full set of NBC protection).  Their transport would be arranged by the army, who'd take charge of hosing them down between visits.   
The Civil Defense would be in charge of distributing supplies like anti-inflammatories and food, fresh water etc.
AGS would take care of civil order and all limits on overtime for all branches would be lifted.
