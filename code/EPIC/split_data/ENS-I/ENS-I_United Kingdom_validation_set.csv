fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0,reddit

fj9evy7,We have legislation permitting a safe injection facility on the cards for the last 5 years. It's been blocked multiple times from planning permission objections.

None of the drugs had been decriminalised but the state has recognised an epidemic and offered a safer system to those at the highest risk levels.
I don't think at this point decriminalization would do shit. we've an rooted black market supply chain that isn't going anywhere, best thing the state can do is provide early education into the long term effects of drug use, heavily change the support infrastructure for those caught in addiction cycles and stop treating em like dregs and leaving em in back alleys.",0,reddit

Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here.
Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!

fj9ycnm,"OK, so, assuming for some reason that we do get a major fucking outbreak with say 200-300,000  infected, people are going to have to be treated at home  while holed up in their rooms. 
Mild cases just need food, supplies and maybe money - middling cases should be treated by community nurses and a few doctors (freed up by the canceling of all elective procedures) who check in on them wearing a full set of NBC protection).  Their transport would be arranged by the army, who'd take charge of hosing them down between visits.   
The Civil Defense would be in charge of distributing supplies like anti-inflammatories and food, fresh water etc.
AGS would take care of civil order and all limits on overtime for all branches would be lifted.

fj9i0a2,"Wanna see a statesman, look no further than Angela Merkel. No wonder she did not shake hands with Modi. Modi does Mann ki Baat. Hindustan mein ek hi insaan ke paas mann hai. Baki sab to chutiye hain. Modi's problem is his bloated ego. That's what made him wave at no one in Dal Lake and use his raw wisdom in inventing new radar technologies. At the same time, he is a thorough coward. He does not want to face people. He does not want to face questions. He lives in his echo chamber of his flatterers and occasionally caters to modia.
I find Modi to be a very insecure person, scared, vengeful, delusional to an extent. He has another side though, which he presents to his audience,.. Brash, resolute, ambitious, flamboyant, dragon-slaying savior of people image. It is a projection. Such a projection would attract most people. He is a populist. One needs to though focus on what he does not do or does not say. That tells about the real Narendra Modi.",Zero press conference in 6 years. Much statesman. smh,0,reddit
