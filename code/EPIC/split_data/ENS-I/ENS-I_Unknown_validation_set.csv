fj5kug6,"That's not my point at all. Hinduism, like most religions is a set of ideologies. And those ideologies do not promote the kind of hate and violence being perpetuated in our country now. Thus, people who do perpetuate said hate and violence in our country calling themselves hindu for doing so are in fact, not.","The whole point of secularism and humanitarianism is that religion does not define our morality. Saying someone is not a real Hindu is like saying that a good hindu's morality comes from the correct ""practice"" of Hinduism. But anyone from any religion can say that about literally any moral stance. If good hindu's are humanitarian and bad Hindus are violent because they're bad Hindus then where does that put atheists?",0,reddit

fj9i0a2,"Wanna see a statesman, look no further than Angela Merkel. No wonder she did not shake hands with Modi. Modi does Mann ki Baat. Hindustan mein ek hi insaan ke paas mann hai. Baki sab to chutiye hain. Modi's problem is his bloated ego. That's what made him wave at no one in Dal Lake and use his raw wisdom in inventing new radar technologies. At the same time, he is a thorough coward. He does not want to face people. He does not want to face questions. He lives in his echo chamber of his flatterers and occasionally caters to modia.
I find Modi to be a very insecure person, scared, vengeful, delusional to an extent. He has another side though, which he presents to his audience,.. Brash, resolute, ambitious, flamboyant, dragon-slaying savior of people image. It is a projection. Such a projection would attract most people. He is a populist. One needs to though focus on what he does not do or does not say. That tells about the real Narendra Modi.",Zero press conference in 6 years. Much statesman. smh,0,reddit
fjcehst,That is hilarious and horrifying.  Thank you for the travel warning.,"They could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
I think for pest species it's the German cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. Even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
If you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast US and you'll see some shit all right. I once spotted one in the kitchen in the house I grew up in down in Florida because I was in the sitting room watching TV and I heard it walking around. I dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when I got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
Oh, and did I mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? Back in Georgia I had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent. Nothing like sitting on the toilet doing your business and hearing this *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* sound descending the vent pipe, and then *schlorp*, out pops an enormous and mildly concussed cockroach which then proceeds to freak the fuck out and go whizzing around the room randomly bouncing off of everything, including your face. 
So yeah, tl;dr: don't look the gift of your lack of cockroaches in the mandibles.",0,reddit
