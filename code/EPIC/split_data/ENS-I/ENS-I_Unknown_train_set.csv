fja4f98,Seems legit. 10/10 would recommend.,"The only way this works is that you apply one kilo of dung, and one litre of urine, of cow, per person. Works better if the cow is red in colour. White cow is the weakest, black is a little better, red works best.
This has to be layered, so the first day, you apply. And wait for it to dry. The next day, DO NOT WASH OFF. Apply the new stuff over the old stuff as a layer.
You have to do this until the summer comes. ~~Or Shivraathri [Feb 20/21, 2020].~~ This process needs to be continued right through summer into the rainy season, and you have to wash it off in the first rain.

DoN't pANiC.","Christ on a crumpet. People are whipping themselves up into a completely unecessary panic about this thing, OP included. Go about your normal business.  Here is the advice of the World Health Organisation:
>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0,reddit

fj58flv,I am really fucking happy for you dude,"Lowest point was probably the year after high school. My parents had divorced and my mom moved out first after keeping me on lockdown because she found out I was dating a girl. Then my dad moved out to live with my now step mom. I went from having no freedom at all to having absolute freedom, and I did not handle it well. I did a lot of drugs and drank a lot of alcohol. Most of the time, the only consumables in the house wee ramen and booze. I didn’t even care about taking care of myself because I was drunk or high all the time. 
I think the highest point is now. I bought a house last September, got out of an unhappy marriage, my teenager is absolutely thriving, I’ve got a decent paying job, published two novels, and I got back together with that same girl I dated twenty years ago. Things are going really well now.",0,reddit

fj5cu36,"What media are you talking about? This is media. Twitter is media. Facebook is media.
People should stop reading sensationalist news and hyper partisan news. They should stop watching entertainment news (And by that, I mean news that’s designed to be entertainment).
People should absolutely read trusted news sources. Journalists do one of the most important jobs in our Democracies and people should absolutely listen to them, learn how to interpret bias and learn how to have an informed opinion based on that interpretation. Read The New York Times *and* The Wall Street Journal. Read The Economist *and* Foreign Policy. Read The National Review *and* USA Today. Watch NPR. These are trusted sources of news and informed opinion from the left and the right and it’s your job as a citizen to read them and use them to form your own opinion.
A society where we’re all just forming our opinions based on what those around us say or what our own timeline says is not a healthy society.",The media. They thrive off of fearmongering and people are dumb enough to fall for that.,0,reddit
