fjbh624,Spotted the cow piss drinker ^,"Why has Reddit become so religiously biased. Every  religion has stuff that is practiced because guys wake the fuck up ... Religion is imagined more imagines and fiction than real.
It's hocus pocus done by a guy wearing fancy clothes. 
Stop taking the Koran literally, it's a book of wisdom not a Standard operation procedure because it was written for a different time. 
Stop taking the Bible very seriously, a lot if it was written way after Jesus was no more.
Manusmriti the hindu guidebook is ridiculous and makes for a good read to understand the wisdom of the time and that's that.
That being said religion is magic to those with faith. So when you make fun of one faith they retaliate and make fun of another. Hurt and pain begets hurt and pain. It's a bad cycle.
So dear reddit stop saying religiously inflammatory shit for any religion.

fjaddij,"Thank you!
Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir¬†David Attenborough¬†has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster¬†told the Daily Telegraph¬†the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these¬†famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children.¬†And who am I to say that you shan't have children?¬†That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity ‚Äì and the most tricky of all ‚Äì is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",1,reddit

fjdzgd6,I got a letter from Cadburys with a town that doesn't exist as well as a county that doesn't exist. I've no idea how An Post got that letter to me.,"Unfortunately, while Bus √âireann and Iarnr√≥id √âireann accept the Student Leap Card as proof of your student status, Dublin Bus, Luas, Dart and Commuter only accept it.
An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to ‚Ç¨1000 plus costs.
What is the reason code on your notice? 
If you appeal it right away it's frozen at the lower rate of ‚Ç¨45 instead of going up to ‚Ç¨100 (if not paid in 28 days) until the decision is made, so if nothing else this will allow you some time to get the money together.",0,reddit
