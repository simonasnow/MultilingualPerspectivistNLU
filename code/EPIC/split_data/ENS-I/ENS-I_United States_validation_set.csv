fj9hwgf,"It would seem the right mask to have personal reserves of ought protect in both directions. That is, protecting: the wearer; and others from the wearer.

It looks like, for example, the valveless https://www.bunnings.com.au/3m-p2-particulate-disposable-respirator-8210-2-pack_p0106620 fits the bill. Noting the explicit 3M™ Cupped Particulate Respirator 8210, P2

fjb70j4,"Thank you for the detail, much appreciated! 😁","There's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year.
Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro.
Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro.
Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.
That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it.

It's generally liked in Sheff, but whether Leeds folk will take to it the same way...well having lived in both places I'm not too sure. I mean they have Broadcasting Tower, which was built when I lived there and I was flabberghasted cos to me it's a fucking disgusting monstrosity. Yet it won awards apparently.

fj9ywus,"Interesting yes, it does have its merits for the kids alright","I work on ski resorts in the winter so maybe I can add to this conversation from a different perspective. Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

Unfortunately it's easier to just get through it than to try to kick up a stink. I know from experience.","Context: I was recently booted from a perm part time job that I held for a year, after I was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20+ a week to 3-6.  
Placed back into Newstart I was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where I had on my file that ""Essential Skills for Work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course I have ever seen.  
English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70). I am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in Python, specifically ML, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
Mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.

That I had worked in the industry already and my CV was great but it was grant season, and jobs wouldn't start being advertised for two months or so.  Literally the ONLY person who listened.

fja3l7b,Chinese McDonald's >> any McDonald's elsewhere. Especially their fried chicken steak and the grilled chicken burger (坂烧鸡腿堡) is amazing and only sold within China.,"I've done a similar thing.
I live in China and McDonald's deliver 24/7, but at the time, after 10pm they only do a limited menu, and you have to buy whole meals.
Well a few of us drunkenly went back to a friend's at about 2am, all hungry, one guy wanted two Big Macs but nothing else, someone else wanted a double cheese burger and nuggets and I wanted nuggets and chicken wings, plus god knows what else 
I explained its meals only and everyone was alright with that, and then the guy turned up and we must be have about 8 large cokes and fries and then all these burgers and nuggets and chicken wings.
Next day I guess the guy woke up forgetting what we'd done as we all got texts asking when the fuck did he open a McDonald's franchise
