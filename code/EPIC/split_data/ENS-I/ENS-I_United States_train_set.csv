fj98uh8,Best reply ever,"I remember this is when my family and I made the move to Brisbane from UK. it was a bit of a culture shock but there is something special about how 90s Australia felt. I loved going going to an outback school, we ended up in dalby. Guys did 'lappies' in the main street. Underage drinking at Marys pub. (not condoning it) Cigarettes will kill you,  MGF, Regurgitator, powderfinger Recovery, custard. nirvana, foo fighters, Pearl jam, yes spice girls lol. Superjesus was my first concert when I was 18 and living with friends in the late 90s. Livid festival.  I used to mosh! Holy crap lol. Mates I made.The balmy house parties in suburban Brisbane at uni. $1 drinks.  my flatmate watching dawsons creek, going to Lions games with her. Jason Akimanis and Luke Power.
most of the 90s I was at school though. In dalby I remember the Great Locust Plague of 1994. And the mouse plague of '93. National anthem at school assembly. heartbreak High, Drazic, X files, and my friend and I used to make cheesy Mulder and Scully birthday cards. Jimeoin and Bobs cooking show. Aussie comedy. four weddings and a funeral. Listening to Lawsie on the radio with my dad on holidays. riding around town on my bike, dropping in on mates. art class. it was the only one I really liked I think, and English, drama. I remember backchatting teachers. Cross Country runs in 35 degree heat. Celing fans. Lynx deorderant. chatting with my best mate outside school for ages about Ab Fab. we gossipped about teachers like Mrs Brown 'how now brownnn cow' as we watched her drive off in her ""Toorak tractor"" we used to say. (its ok, bitchiness was deserved),internet got connected in my house when I was in grade 12, I thought it was the biggest deal to be able to chat to a rando across the world.  school camp at Tallebudgera where apparently everyone isn't scared of heights except me. a bat flying into our cabin. my friend screaming. bahaha. Electric blue streaks in my hair. (18) because I thought that was cool ha. qcs exams. excitement about moving out. the last week of school.  yearbooks and saying goodbye. two girls wore the same dress to the year 12 formal and it was awkward.  schoolies. sorry for the punctuation, good thread.",0,reddit

Not only what his stupid joke unfunny, he repeated it again the next day with a smug face, looking back at his colleagues as if he was a school yard bully.
What is wrong with measuring how happy a society is instead of just looking at monetary figures?
I think it's a great idea in this modern age.  We could use the results and data to focus funding on improving quality of life for people instead of just looking at the books.
It's a no brainer yet this clown and his party are taking the piss out of a great idea simply because it came from the ALP.

fj7u6bp,China also attempted to silence the doctor and refused to recognise the virus. The doctor died as a result.,"For all the shit people like to talk about ""totalitarian communist China"" all the time, the above reads an awful lot like in a crisis it's generally better to be governed by China than anybody else.
Take hospital beds alone:
> China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3%
China actually has beds for more than 0.4%: 4.34 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.434%.
Ireland? Less than 0.3%: 2.96 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.296%.  
Not only do they have THREE orders of magnitude more people, but they also have 47% percent MORE hospital beds for all of those people.

An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to ‚Ç¨1000 plus costs.
What is the reason code on your notice?

Then there are certain cohorts who think that clearing and blowing their noses and shotgun blasting the hand basin with snot  and blood is normal behavior.

We don‚Äôt want what‚Äôs happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we‚Äôre a remarkably self sufficient nation.

That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren‚Äôt expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here‚Äôs the thing, you probably don‚Äôt. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant.

At Mumbai international airport, arrivals from SEA countries: Temperature reading, and that was that.","Been wondering about this as well. I am skeptical about any explanation that gives credit to our ""robust border checks and systems"" - those do not exist.
Looking at the list of countries affected, you will see that the rich and developed countries are at the top, and the poor and underdeveloped countries are reporting less than 10 cases. It almost looks like an Olympics medal tally table.

fjdjo24,"They do, they include current rent and savings as part of their stress tests for affordability. You have to be able to show you earn enough that you can pay rent and save significantly as well as afford to live. So they know you can keep paying if interest rates go up.
Its just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
In fairness both are reasonable rules.
The problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
Developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",Why don't banks accept your years worth of on time rent payments?!

Soap making, even from a ""you're in a forest and it's the stone age"" level, is actually pretty easy of course, but very labor-intensive compared to going to a shop and buying it, sigh...",I'm still washing my hands. Besides I know I won't get it.,0,reddit

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0,reddit

Hindu supremacists were voted into power, they introduced an anti-Muslim bill, Muslims in Delhi and other parts of the country protested, the centre sent mobs to indiscriminately kill Muslims, loot them, rape them and destroy their properties. Mosques were destroyed and they raised a Hanuman flag on top of a mosque. The police also took part in this. 
Then why is it so hard to say that this is a pogrom against Muslim people? There is overwhelming evidence, and has been for a while now. You‚Äôre looking at Kashmir, UP, Delhi. All of the statements coming from the government are blatantly islamophobic, BJP supporters are blatantly islamophobic. So why can‚Äôt the obvious be stated? Why does every story in the news cycle have to be about both sides, when it‚Äôs just one side that is disproportionately affected?

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
‚Ä¢ Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
‚Ä¢ Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
‚Ä¢ Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
‚Ä¢ Bond will now be capped at four weeks‚Äô rent.
‚Ä¢ Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
‚Ä¢ Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
‚Ä¢ Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
‚Ä¢ Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren‚Äôt held liable for the debts of their abusers.
‚Ä¢ Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
Tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. Oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‚Äòno specified reason‚Äô notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",0,reddit

The hse can't keep these secrets not only because it's impossible since we'll find out anyway but also and more importantly we have a right to know more details about threats to our families so we can make our own decisons..
For example, I needed to know what school this was last night because if it had been near me I wouldn't have sent my kid  to pre-school today as a precaution. That's my choice given my own families circumstances. But I need accurate info in order to make that choice. And this choice to protect an entire school's ""privacy"" forced me to find out the name of the school through Reddit last night, not the people who are in charge of managing the crisis.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir¬†David Attenborough¬†has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster¬†told the Daily Telegraph¬†the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these¬†famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children.¬†And who am I to say that you shan't have children?¬†That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity ‚Äì and the most tricky of all ‚Äì is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",1,reddit

fjciuic,Bus driver sounds like he was on a power trip.,"Aside from tourists sitting in the priority season and ignoring me standing with a nine months pregnant belly, or the bus on New Year's with a bunch of young kids drinking who then started shouting ""Let us off! Emergency!"" while one of the boys vomited all over the bus floor, here's my favorite.
About a month ago I was leaving the GP with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so I had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. I get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". He won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am I supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""
If I could have held my screaming baba up to that man's ear like a seashell, I would have. I get that rules are rules, but it was kind of ridiculous.",1,reddit

Because of how famous it is, it attracts all sorts of crowd. Personally I thought it had a creepy vibe.... more scope of getting pervy messages. I would be a little careful here.
Hinge - Hinge is the most favored one, the crowd is fairly decent. The platform itself encourages open discussions and keeps the conversation fun and engaging. Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe. Though they are good I didn't find many guys who were looking for ""marriage"" they were open to dating, meeting and taking it from there. Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.
Matrimony sites - Shaadi.com involves creating an extensive profile with lots of details. It allows you to restrict your search related to caste, religion, veg - non veg, smoking drinking etc. The agenda is very clear so everyone on that site knows they are looking for a life partner... conversations are more honest and open... Though there will be lots of people who will reach out to you , dont be surprised if some guy's mom or brother reach out. Have clear boundaries about how much you want to engage, and set the expectations from the get go. There are some good guys there, but you gotta keep looking!

When talking about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the British Book Awards, Sanjeev Bhaskar stated that he chose 42 as the house number because in the Hitchhiker's series 42 features prominently as the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.","The book is what got me into reading, [I mean I could read, but was 'too cool' for it as a teen], when I was about 15. 
Saw a program about top 100 books, where actors introducted a book/acted some of it out, and hitchhikers was presented by 
Sanjeev Bhaskar. He acted out some of stuff about the computer giving the ""42"" answer and I found it hilarious. Read the book, then the next one.......and the other 3 as well. Loved every single page of them. 
Since then, these books have spun me off into reading anything/everything I can get my hands on. So thank you Douglas Adams and Sanjeev for bringing this to my attention some 16+ years ago.",0,reddit
