I explained its meals only and everyone was alright with that, and then the guy turned up and we must be have about 8 large cokes and fries and then all these burgers and nuggets and chicken wings.

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0,reddit

Upvoting this not because I totally believe you but for the simple fact that there are a lot of factors and variables involved wrt immunity including local environment, genetics, temperatures etc. It's a very interesting read.
OP mentioned a couple of published parameters and promptly concurred hand sanitizers are the best! (read sarcasm). Well, I need proof and references for the same, to objectively and conclusively prove or reject it. Otherwise, it's in the same league of those UN WhatsApp forwards.  
Hygiene is common sense but immunity is a different ball game.  
I mean, there are actual people writing their thesis on the same as we speak and along comes a  Google powered research paper.  
Till then, I think it would be best to leave the deductions to the specialists.","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

fjdoskx,"A partner is far more likely to be infected - because of things like kissing. But siblings/parents etc are less because not kissing. But obviously they are definitely at risk because living in close quarters is known to spread things like this - look at norovirus. 
I would say the whole idea of not quarantining the families unless the exposed is showing symptoms is because if theyre not showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing etc) theyre probably not spreading it very far. You have to exchange bodily fluid to infect, so the idea is probably (hazarding a guess) that they aren't exchanging saliva etc. Will be interesting to see when an adult is diagnosed if they quarantine their partner.","If a family member becomes infected and self isolated, isn’t it too late for the rest of the family at that stage? Because they would’ve been in close contact before the symptoms showed up. 
Say you’d kissed your partner the night before and then next day they have symptoms. Won’t you be guaranteed to get it too?",0,reddit

fj5bb3y,She is either dead or locked in a bunker.,"David Miscavige, the chairman of the Church of Scientology definitely murdered his wife and is getting off scott free for it. Him and his wife got into a pretty heated argument in 2007, and she hasn’t been seen since. Lawyers hired by David claim she is still alive and devotes 100% of her time to work at the church of scientology, which is why she hasn’t been seen since August 2007. In 2013, a former member of the church had filed a missing person report that was closed after a few officers had “spoken and seen Mrs.Miscavige”, even though there’s no evidence whatsoever of this meeting. All missing person’s reports now are turned down since this investigation is forever closed.",0,reddit
