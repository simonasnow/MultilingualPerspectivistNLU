fj53b3u,How do you feel when you are having a lucid dream? I want to experiment it but I'm also scared of it,"1)Get your dream recall up. This is the hardest part. You have to realize you’re dreaming so to do that you need to find Dream signs, common dream themes for you, etc. 
You can do this by keeping a dream journal. 
Also practice all day awareness. Ask yourself randomly if you’re dreaming throughout the day and perform dream checks. There are lots. The easiest and most discreet are the index finger through the palm (in dreams it goes through) and holding your nose and breathing which allows breathing in dreams. 
2) Practice different techniques. 
DILD-Dream induced. This one is the easiest but less reliable. By this point you should know some Dream signs (electronics malfunction, lights don’t work, words in books are strange, your mirrors reflection) and you just notice you’re dreaming. 
WILD- Probably the most reliable, but many people report Sleep paralysis with it.  It’s a wake induced LD. Essentially you time your sleep cycle just right and try to enter during REM or closer to it. 
There are others too FILD- Finger induced, DEILD- dream exit induced. There’s tons but those are probably the most common. 
3). You’re lucid!  But you’ll probably find the dream world instantly disappears or spins or you wake up (also look up false awakenings, those are fun). To do this you need to learn stabilization. 
So calm down and slowly spin around. This stabilized the dream for most people. Another one is to rub your hands together slowly. 
Think that’s about the basics. Don’t buy anything like masks.  They don’t work. Supplements have different effects for everyone. Melatonin helps me recognize my dreams but just because it makes them so vivid.",0,reddit

Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children. And who am I to say that you shan't have children? That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity – and the most tricky of all – is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",1,reddit

However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

fjb70j4,"Thank you for the detail, much appreciated! 😁","There's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year.
Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro.
Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro.
Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.
That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it.

Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0,reddit
