fj62jxi,As a Muslim this is exactly what they want us to do- react with violence on a large scale. All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.",1

He will be cracking one out to coronavirus
I couldn't give the tiniest shit how well he narrates nature documentaries
He is fucking evil
Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children. ""To start with, it is the individual's great privilege to have children. And who am I to say that you shan't have children? That's one thing,"" he said. ""And the last sensitivity – and the most tricky of all – is the fact, when you talk about world population, the areas we're talking about are Africa and Asia, you know.""",1

fjacwyq,">We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised.
There is a little logic to this, but NOT when confronted by a pandemic! This is a new strain of virus which we have NOT been exposed to before, and we have NOT built up immunity towards. By not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
Not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. So you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. SO PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS!","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.
