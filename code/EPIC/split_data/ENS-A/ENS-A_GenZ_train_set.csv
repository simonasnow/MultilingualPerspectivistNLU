Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

Ireland? Less than 0.3%: 2.96 beds per 1000 people, i.e. 0.296%.  
Not only do they have THREE orders of magnitude more people, but they also have 47% percent MORE hospital beds for all of those people.

fjcju5l,"Thanks! I think I'm inclined towards the Himalayan, given everything I've read here and on other sites. I'm in India now and will probably visit a KTM showroom or two, though, just to get a feel for the 390. 
I'll check out the BMW G310, just since a few folks have recommended it. It looks to be at the top end of my budget, but there's a chance I may have enough money--my language program is fully funded and comes with a stipend, so if I can save enough money for a BMW, I can get one. 
However, I do have to wonder how practical it'd be to get one fixed on the fly. The big advantage of Enfields, at least in my experience, is that just about any mechanic in India can fix one in a relatively short period of time. 
I've actually had much better luck with REs in India than overseas, in part because a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by higher average speeds in the U.S.","The only good offroading bikes in India right now in your budget are the KTM Adventure, RE Himalayan, Hero Xpulse and Bajaj Dominar. Though the dominar is not a full fledged off roader it is capable enough as it shares tye same underpinnings as its cousin KTM Duke . The BMW G310 ss is slightly over your budget, so is the KTM Adventure 390, both of these are slightly above 3 lakhs on road after local taxes but are more powerful than all the other options. The Himalayan comes in your budget and the newer 411cc BS6 ones are more reliable than the older BS4 ones, but with RE the problem is you never know when you might get a Lemon. That brings us down to Hero Xpulse whose 200cc engine is underpowered for off-roaders but is good enough in the city. 
If you are the gambling kind i would suggest the Himalayan, otherwise stick to any of the rest. Since you already owned a classic 500 you would be familiar with the temperament of a bullet.",0

And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year.
Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro.
Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro.
Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.

Experts are saying just buy a little EXTRA each week, don’t try to have your own Woollies at home and do all your shopping for a year. We don’t want what’s happening in Germany - entire shelves bare - to happen to us. Remember we’re a remarkably self sufficient nation. Have a pantry and have enough; but let’s not make the tragedy of the commons happen for our neighbours. 
That being said, I keep a steady supply of pasta, canned tomatoes, beans, rice, canned citrus fruits and frozen food at all times. I grew up rural and lived in a survivalist community part time in my late teens, so having a well stocked pantry is never a bad thing. 
Remember: even in Wuhan right now, everyone has access to delivered groceries. Expensive and with some shortages, but no one is starving and even the Chinese government is sending in free food. 
Remember: often food shortages are created by overbuying! It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. Food makers aren’t expecting every citizen to suddenly need a six month supply and here’s the thing, you probably don’t. 
What you do need - hand sanitiser (harder to come by - was just in Canberra and Gundagai and all supermarkets are wiped clear), thermometer, ibuprofen, hospital grade disinfectant. If it runs out in stores because people are being Chicken Littles, vinegar kills 80% of germs. As someone else said, toilet paper is great and you’ll miss it when you don’t have it. Garbage bags too.

Get a power bank for $20 from Kmart (and a back up one if you really can’t stand your own company ?), a solar powered battery power bank and a hand crank radio.

fjcehst,That is hilarious and horrifying.  Thank you for the travel warning.,"They could be everywhere, but the vast majority aren't pest species that interact with humans; most that do live here (if any) are probably all hiding out in the woods and gorse and all and staying the fuck away from people. 
I think for pest species it's the German cockroaches that you'd find here the most, but they aren't native; usually they get brought over in shipments or in people's luggage and then go on to infest the surrounding buildings. Even the pest ones are very skittish and good at hiding, so your building could easily be full of 'em without you noticing for a long time, and if you see one, he almost certainly has a few thousand close relatives nearby out of sight. 
If you really want to see cockroaches for some strange reason, just head to the southeast US and you'll see some shit all right. I once spotted one in the kitchen in the house I grew up in down in Florida because I was in the sitting room watching TV and I heard it walking around. I dropped a cereal bowl on top of it and went to go grab something to capture it with, and when I got back the entire fucking bowl was trundling across the kitchen floor; that thing gave no fucks. 
Oh, and did I mention some of the bigger ones (yes, there were bigger ones) fly? Back in Georgia I had a nest of 'em take up residence on my roof once, and every now and again one would get lost up there and fall down the chimney or the bathroom vent. Nothing like sitting on the toilet doing your business and hearing this *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* *thud* sound descending the vent pipe, and then *schlorp*, out pops an enormous and mildly concussed cockroach which then proceeds to freak the fuck out and go whizzing around the room randomly bouncing off of everything, including your face.

All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance.

fjacwyq,">We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised.
There is a little logic to this, but NOT when confronted by a pandemic! This is a new strain of virus which we have NOT been exposed to before, and we have NOT built up immunity towards. By not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
Not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. So you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. SO PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS!","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Fuck David Attenborough
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/18/david-attenborough-famine-population
Sending food aid to famine-stricken countries avoids the more fundamental problem of population growth, Sir David Attenborough has said, as he called for more debate about population control.
The renowned broadcaster told the Daily Telegraph the world was ""heading for disaster"", and without action the ""natural world will do something"".
""What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about?"" he said. ""They're about too many people for too little land. That's what it's about. And we are blinding ourselves. We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That's barmy.""
He admitted the issues had huge sensitivities, but insisted it was important to ""just keep on about it"".
One area of concern, he said, was about the right to have children.

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",0

Emergency!"" while one of the boys vomited all over the bus floor, here's my favorite.
About a month ago I was leaving the GP with my daughter who was 4 months old and sick, so I had the pram with me to put her in if it started raining and she was strapped to my chest in the carrier because she needs a good cuddle when she's not feeling well. I get on the bus with my pram and go to sit down when the bus driver starts shouting at me that ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!!"". He won't move the bus, and the pram doesn't really fold easily, not to mention how am I supposed to fold it down with a sick baby strapped to me?? I go to explain I can't fold it and the driver just keeps telling me ""all unoccupied prams must be folded and stored!""
I had no choice, I pulled my daughter out of the carrier, apologized to the people around and let them know she was going to cry and put my now screaming sick baby into the pram and said ""it's not unoccupied now.""

fj93yqz,"> ! If you kill the Cows for the Beef....where you will get the in-demand, and nutritious Cow's Milk that you depend on - from ?
We don't breed separate cattle for meat in india. Beef comes from non productive cattle - cows that no longer produce milk and build that are no longer used in agriculture or transport. Cow economics depends on meat consumption to keep it viable. Don't listen me, read the works of the father of indian white revolution, varghese kurrien. Then ask yourself why farmers in up are locking up stray cattle in schools and government offices in record numbers after bhogiji's cow slaughter ban.","It's the Economic Benefits, stupid !

And plenty of people enjoy chicken skin and bacon fat and the rind on steak. Eating the bits that aren't meat is normal. (As an aside I don't especially like those things because of mouth-feel, but if you made a sausage out of them and it was tasty I don't see why that's somehow disgusting in princple.)
