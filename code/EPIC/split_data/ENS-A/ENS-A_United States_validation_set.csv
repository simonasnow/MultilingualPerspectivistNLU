fj7ha0g,The wage calculation test is correct if your a “wage” theft employer. Maybe it’s how they condition new workers....,"Context: I was recently booted from a perm part time job that I held for a year, after I was made casual 2 weeks prior to being booted and hours going from 20+ a week to 3-6.  
Placed back into Newstart I was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where I had on my file that ""Essential Skills for Work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course I have ever seen.  
English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70). I am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in Python, specifically ML, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
Mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.  
Edit 2, the sequel: It is not too. Currently lodging a formal complaint as my Employment Provider is refusing to negotiate my contract with them to get me out of this nightmare.",1

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",0

The New England Patriots are one of the most successful franchises in history, in one of the wealthiest parts of the country that has a ton of disposable income and a love of football. That’s no coincidence.

Am sorry say this here(might even get banned), but these are early sings of getting radicalized, please seek help asap.","True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them.

All it will achieve is with more innocent bloodshed and allowing the RSS-BJP terrorists to come back to power in 2024 with even greater majority by gaining the sympathy of the majority who will see them as saviors. The Sanghis basically use the Israel model of unity through hatred which works because most Indians(including Muslims) are communal in nature irrespective of educational background. The problem is not Hinduism or Islam. No religion encourages violence or hatred. The issue is the politics of this country depend on the exploitation and brainwash of it's naive population who blindly believe the Divider in Chief as long as he makes bullshit promises of safety and prosperity and no matter how many times he fucks them they will gladly bend over and take it. Hitler used the same type of propaganda the Sanghis use and if people don't think it works- have a good look at the state of this country.,"True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.",0

fjdjo24,"They do, they include current rent and savings as part of their stress tests for affordability. You have to be able to show you earn enough that you can pay rent and save significantly as well as afford to live. So they know you can keep paying if interest rates go up.
Its just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
In fairness both are reasonable rules.
The problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
Developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",Why don't banks accept your years worth of on time rent payments?!

Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there. The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.
Most scientists counsel caution, however. “The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” says Woolhouse. “We will just have to wait and see.”",0

An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to €1000 plus costs.
What is the reason code on your notice? 
If you appeal it right away it's frozen at the lower rate of €45 instead of going up to €100 (if not paid in 28 days) until the decision is made, so if nothing else this will allow you some time to get the money together.",0

They also slung cats and dogs out of the top floor of apartment buildings, so we should probably start doing that too.",Face masks don't help you from catching it said on tv tonight. It only stops from spreading if you have it so no need to wear one.,1

fjasu0c,"So you're saying to smash his window in. Got it. Brb, finding a brick and a trebuchet ready for the morning. Haha","We have a guy who lives underneath us who is an asshole with his taxi. He leaves it running at all hours of the day whilst sitting in it, leaves it on the grassy verge which has now turned it into a mud pit, parks it terribly thus blocking half the road and has also blocked my partner's car in before. He also has a hobby of leaving his incredibly vocal dog sitting in the car whilst he does chores in his garden at all hours (the earliest we've had is 6:30, on that occasion we told him to shut up).
Recently someone smashed his window, not a clue who it is and in all honesty don't particularly care bar the fact that he now thinks it's someone in the local area who has a Vendetta against him and it is massively working in our favour. He asked why someone might've done it and we've just rattled off all our grievances with him.
Since then he's been far better and I'm kinda glad it happened? Although I'm also sure he blames us even though we weren't in the city that night. The power and lack of legal responsibility is really enjoyable.",1

fjbvb8n,What are you talking about? What manifesto was made into law?,"The government response to the massacre was appalling and disrespectful to the victims.
There should be laws preventing the public office enacting Terrorist Manifestos into law and fulfilling the homicidal fantasy of such people.",0

Sinking in league tables, no real trade deals, the pound sinking, rates up - high inflation  - freedom of movement lost - I see nothing good!  A  dictatorial country for the rich. Wake up!","Reminder Brexit really wasn’t about a US trade deal, it wasn’t really about an economic doctrine. It was really about believing your nation state is where the highest form of govt should lie. It was basically about democracy.",1
