fj9o1hk,">sceptical with comparing India with Pakistan. 
>india is headed the way of Hindu Pakistan. 
ఠ_ಠ","While I am skeptical with comparing India with Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are definitely heading the way of Hindu Pakistan. There is active incitement of violence by BJP and I believe that is to provoke a reaction that can be used by them to trigger a religious war. We are now caught in the vicious cycle of usage of religious hate to ignore problems of importance (economy, jobs, farmer distress etc) which further shifts the focus away from these problems. I am sure after this Delhi thing calms down, BJP will trigger havoc through something else.",both

fj6caaj,">But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism
Am sorry say this here(might even get banned), but these are early sings of getting radicalized, please seek help asap.","True. Back in 1993 or the IM run from 2004-2007, the bombings felt unfair because neither governments nor society supported babri. Babri was carried out by what was seen as a fringe extremist group, but everybody in society paid the price. I have no problem calling those bombings terrorism.
But if bombings happen now, I'll actually call it armed resistance rather than condemn it as terrorism. Government, judiciary, media, police, bulk of hindu society itself - are arrayed against them. If they are forced into a fight they didn't want in the first place, it's not terrorism but resistance. Bhagat Singh might have thrown bombs, but he was not a terrorist - he was a resistance fighter.",0

fj9gxri,Thanks for the information! Hope I can navigate all this well!,"Firstly 28 isn't old, so don't tell yourself that! 
Dating websites in India are a mess, however if you had to pick Bumble might be the best of the lot. Bumble doesn't allow men to initiate a conversation once they match, only women can. Aisle isn't bad, but it's got an awful interface and most things need you to pay.
If you are looking for a serious relationship, matrimonial websites are the best because you know that people there are looking for something similar. I would strongly suggest creating the profile by yourself and being in control of it. Most websites allow a filter for who is handling the account, seeing profiles handled by parents/friends can be an no no for people.

fjb70j4,"Thank you for the detail, much appreciated! ?","There's not enough details in this post, but let's assume 4 day week to make up 30 hours, that's 8 trips. And maybe one return trip at weekends every second week (I'm being conservative). Average of 9 trips a week then. Let's say 2.60 each, that's 23.40 a week, below the cap. That works out 1,216.8 a year.
Current tax liability is 18,000 multiplied by 0.2=3,600. Let's assume credits of 3,300, so annual tax liability of 300. With this relief taxable income would be 16,550, liability = 16,550 multiplied by 0.2=3,310, minus tax credits of 3,300 means final annual tax liability of 10 euro. Savings of 290 euro.
Also save on prsi but 18,000/52=346 a week, which is less than 352 so no prsi liability, therefore nothing to save on.
Finally, USC, the 1,450 would not be subject to USC, so that's 2% of 1,450, = 29 euro.
Total savings of 319 euro, meaning the ticket will really have a net cost of 1,131.
That's a saving of 85.8 a year compared to the cost I calculated in my example. Then take into account nitelinks, which are included in the tax saver ticket. And the convenience of it.

It's generally liked in Sheff, but whether Leeds folk will take to it the same way...well having lived in both places I'm not too sure. I mean they have Broadcasting Tower, which was built when I lived there and I was flabberghasted cos to me it's a fucking disgusting monstrosity. Yet it won awards apparently.

Young gent P1 comes to the door. Regular knows we search. Hands over his wallet, boom bag of cocaine . 

B1 “Sorry mate that’s getting destroyed, and you’re not coming in, however you’ve not caused issues before so come back next week and all is forgiven” 
Sounds fair right? 
P1 “ok I’ll go, can I have that back?”
B2 “err no mate”
P1 “ why not?”
B1 “because we’re not drug dealers! Of course you can’t have it back we’re all under cctv and this will be destroyed under camera too”
P1 “ I don’t believe you’ll destroy it!”
(Note: Many people seem to think bouncers either all take or sell gear, it’s not true and even if one of us wanted drugs we’re not gonna trust something that you could have got anywhere and done anything to)
B1 “it’s not my job to convince you of anything mate, been nice, been fair now please listen to your GF and go home”
