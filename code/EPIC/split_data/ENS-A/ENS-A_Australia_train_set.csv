fj8tzto,">  Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
Why shouldnt a landlord be able to get the most rent possible?  In future wont they just advertise a lot higher rent then add 'or nearest offer'? 
>Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications.
Will the tenant have to make good any changes, e.g. if they add a lot of screw holes to a wall surely they have to repair and repaint the room.","These reforms are fucking great. I'm so happy. 
• Landlords must now ensure their properties meet basic standards, providing functioning stoves, heating and deadlocks, and maintaining basic safety standards for gas, electricity and smoke alarms.
• Rental bidding will be banned, preventing landlords from accepting a higher price than advertised.
• Landlords may only increase rent every 12 months, as opposed to every six months as currently stands.
• Bond will now be capped at four weeks’ rent.
• Landlords may no longer unreasonably refuse consent to minor modifications. This covers nailing hooks to walls and anchoring furniture for safety. But they can request these modifications be made by a qualified person.
• Landlords will now need an official order from the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in order to refuse a tenant the right to own a pet.
• Tenants will no longer need written consent from their landlord to file for the release of their bond. The landlord will have 14 days to dispute the claim, or bond will be repaid to the tenant automatically after that time.
• Victims of family violence will be able to terminate rental agreements to ensure they aren’t held liable for the debts of their abusers.
• Caravan and mobile home owners will now be offered access to compensation if their residential park closes.

Fucking rental bidding. I've had to do it. Such a shit of an underhanded practise. Getting calls from the agent... well, there are a lot of people interested... 
Tell them directly that rent bidding is illegal. Oh, we're not doing that, we're just letting you know there are a lot of people interested...
There are more coming into effect in July 2020: https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/changes-to-renting-laws/all-changes-in-place-from-july-2020
Some highlights:
Inappropriate rental application questions
A rental provider or their agent cannot request inappropriate information in a rental application.
Rental providers must give a valid reason to end a rental agreement
Rental providers (landlords) cannot issue a ‘no specified reason’ notice to vacate. To end a rental agreement, rental providers must provide a valid reason such as sale, change of use or demolition of the rental property, or rental provider moving back into the rental property.
Evidence for change of use notice to vacate
Rental providers must attach documentary evidence to a notice to vacate for change of use. The Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria will specify the types of evidence that must be used, for example a building permit.
Bank or other mortgage provider to honour rental agreements
If a bank or other mortgage provider has consented to the mortgage recipient entering a rental agreement with the mortgaged property, upon taking possession of the property they are subject to all the provisions of the Act as though they were the rental provider.
Expanded definition for urgent repairs
Urgent repairs now include repairs or replacements relating to air conditioning, safety devices and any fault or damage which makes the property unsafe or insecure, including pest infestations, or mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure.
Long-term leases
Renters and rental providers (landlords) can enter a fixed-term rental agreement for longer than five years. They must use the prescribed form to do so.",1

fj7btdx,"Completely understand your sentiment. It's tough. You're always overthinking some aspect of said friendship be it straight or gay guy. Very frustrating. 
Absolutely, I'm loyal to a fault and if I make plans with someone I will always stick to them unless I'm sick or something. Very rare nowadays to get someone who will do that for you.","Making mates as a fully fledged adult is a widely shared challenge. Being a gay lad also has its own unique problems attached to the challenge. I agree with your sentiments with regards to other gay guys. It’s very difficult for many, myself included, upon knowing someone new is gay, to separate their sexuality and not consider having sex with them. Just thinking of someone in that regard is going to really skew the foundations of a friendship developing organically.
On the other end, becoming mates with straight lads, I’ve gotten great at shutting down notions of dating or sex with a guy once I find out he’s straight. Yet there is a general sense of unease when I meet new straight guys, I think most of it stems from me being overly cautious to  ensure they don’t think I’m in any way coming on to them at all, I would hate to make someone feel uncomfortable in that way. So baseline friendliness is reduced as a result because I’m over-compensating for them knowing I’m gay and being perhaps sensitive to anything I may do or say.
Clearly I’m reading a lot into it here, but I ask myself similar questions as you appear to be. The friends I have made as an adult have been through work and one guy I did briefly date that we managed to transition to a good friendship. 
Whatever your avenue, gaming, sports, acting etc. so much of life, of success and of friendship is just solely about showing up, being present and demonstrating that you are reliable. Flakiness abounds in society lately so defying this trend says a lot nowadays. I think many people say and state they are into this that and the other, but say it simply to appear and fool themselves as being interesting engaged people but who rarely if ever actively participate in their stated hobbies.
Instead, actually go to that event, attend that talk, enter that competition, in the words of the great Shia La Beouf; “just do it!”",1

Closure ordered after student identified as first case in Republic

Updated: 2 minutes ago
A Dublin school with 400 pupils is to close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus.
The teenager, who is the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus, became ill in recent days after returning from Italy and is in isolation in Dublin hospital.
Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.
The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.
The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it.
Low risk
It is understood the risk to other pupils in the Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.
Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.
hospital as officials trace contacts
Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.
There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.
The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening:
“Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.
The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.
All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.
Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.
Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.
“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”
The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”
Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.
The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health.",0

You have to do this until the summer comes. ~~Or Shivraathri [Feb 20/21, 2020].~~ This process needs to be continued right through summer into the rainy season, and you have to wash it off in the first rain.

English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70).

There is a little logic to this, but NOT when confronted by a pandemic! This is a new strain of virus which we have NOT been exposed to before, and we have NOT built up immunity towards. By not washing your hands and sanitizing when such a virus is going around, you are being very irresponsible. 
Not washing hands, sanitizing, and taking precautions will only further spread the virus, and it is people with weak immune systems like the elderly, babies and the ill who are most likely to die from this disease. So you may survive, but you also may spread it to someone else with low immunity who will die. SO PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS!","Human immune system learns through trial and error. The thing is western world is too fragile for Indian conditions, conditions highly optimal for growth and proliferation of infectious microorganisms (which includes the germs). Also we do not have a cold cycle (at least in the parts southern to regions where it snows) which can wipe out almost all of the infectious microbes. In Europe and America, the immune system of the people is not worked out as much as an Indian's immune system. Half of the year the immune system of western population is chilling owning to the environmental conditions favouring humans over microorganisms. 
The memory of the way to defend the  body from the microorganisms (henceforth microbes) is short lived (for about 30-50 days). Hence as soon as the cold cycle ends and the conditions turn favourable for the microbes and all the memory of the immune system of how to defend itself from the microbe is gone. All the microbes are aliens to the body even though there might not be a significant change in the microbes characteristics. Hence there prevention is best and hence the sanitizers , extreme safety precautions etc are brought about.
In case of India where the environmental situation is highly favourable to the microbes than the humans. We taking extreme precautions (like sanitizers for one) is just a waste of money and time. This habits truly makes you immunologically weaker & compromised. 
Hence we can say that we are inherently stronger than our western counterparts.

Men on hinge are better at conversations and it has less creepy vibe.

Hinge felt like a safe space to talk to cute guys and work on your dating skills, and you do end up meeting cool people.

fjdjo24,"They do, they include current rent and savings as part of their stress tests for affordability. You have to be able to show you earn enough that you can pay rent and save significantly as well as afford to live. So they know you can keep paying if interest rates go up.
Its just they also need a 10-20% deposit to cover the possibility of negative equity so the value of your house if sold in a down market still covers the cost of the outstanding loan.
In fairness both are reasonable rules.
The problem is not the lending rules, its the price of property being entirely unaffordable to begin with and if you loosen the rules it will just drive prices higher again.
Developers not building affordable properties on desirable land when they can build higher margin luxury properties instead is the problem. Its up to the planning authorities to control what gets build where and insist on a higher proportion of higher density affordable properties being built in these developments.",Why don't banks accept your years worth of on time rent payments?! I've been paying rent for 5 years on time without issues and it's more expensive than monthly mortgage payments. Loads of us have a proven track record of it.

fj9ywus,"Interesting yes, it does have its merits for the kids alright","I work on ski resorts in the winter so maybe I can add to this conversation from a different perspective. Not that I'm justifying a ski holiday being superior to any other kind of holiday or that it's the best choice in relation to a curriculum. However, the school prompting a decision from the parents allows the child to have an experience they may not otherwise ever have. If given the choice, a family holiday will likely be a sun holiday. Colder weather at a higher cost isn't usually compelling if the norm is a sunny, sandy beach. 
Skiing and snowboarding (amongst many, many other sports one can do in snowy and mountainous regions) are incredibly fun sports wholly unique from most activities easily available in Ireland. This, coupled with the company of a child's closest friends could make for the holiday of a lifetime and could even create a love for the sport across the family. If it's feasible for a family without causing any financial issues then I think it's absolutely worth it.

Because our econmical outcome is looking worse and worse and the government isn't or can't do anything about it, the RBA has decided to lower the interest rate to 0.5%.

fj5df9v,Totally got sucked down the rabbit hole on this.,"That Diana Ross and Smokey Robinson are Michael Jackson's actual parents. That's why he was the talent in the Jackson family and why there were rumors that he was Evan Ross's father (they both look like Diana). Smokey would've been 18 and Diana 14 years old when Michael was born so Berry Gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from Chicago, Joe Jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the Jackson 5. Joe had a big family where Michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and Motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.
It turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the Jackson 5 make it to Motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of Diana Ross in Gary, Indiana such as at the school talent show where the Jackson 5 performed. She has said multiple times on live television that Michael is her baby/child, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. She has also said publically she was in love with Smokey Robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in Detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. Diana also changed high schools around the time Michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). She was going to Cass-Tech to study home economics and Smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and Motown hadn't broke big yet. A decade later the Jackson 5 auditioned for Motown in Detroit, then did a second performance at a Motown get-together at Berry's house, and Michael has stated that at that point Diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.
There's a movie called Double Platinum which stars Diana Ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with Michael. Her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt Michael wore for Billie Jean at Motown 25. It's written by Michael in his autobiography Moonwalk that he and the Jacksons lived with Diana Ross in Hollywood Hills when the Jackson 5 first signed to Motown and moved to LA, and her and Michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. This would have been when Diana Ross revealed to Michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (This wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with Berry Gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) Smokey Robinson also stated when he was leaving the Larry King interview shortly after Michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of Michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and Bobby Taylor, who is said to have discovered the Jackson 5 even though their first album at Motown was presented by Diana Ross. 
This was also what Michael meant in the song Billie Jean when ""this happened much too soon, she called me to her room"". Diana was the one who said ""I am the one, but the kid is not my son"". She meant I am your mother but you're not my son, you're a Jackson now. Diana Ross is Billie Jean (Diana plays a character called Billie Holiday in 'Lady Sings the Blues' which came out a few years before 'The Wiz' with MJ). This is also what the song Dirty Diana is about, it's about Diana Ross the groupie who seduces Smokey Robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving Michael. Then there's the song Who Is It which is about a mystery person who abandoned Michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'Diana'. The song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' also talks about how ""if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby"" and again refers to the mystery Billie Jean character. He references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the song Leave Me Alone and says ""Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama"". He also references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the songs Baby Be Mine, Speechless, and Keep The Faith. This is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between Michael Jackson and Diana Ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.
Recently a video surfaced of Diana Ross singing You Are Not Alone to Katherine Jackson; just like how she probably used to sing Ain't No Mountain High Enough to Michael when he was living with her. This is seen in the aforementioned movie Double Platinum as well, Diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. And in TMZ's video ""The Last Time We Saw Joe Jackson"" an old senile Joe says ""I raised Michael, he's my son and Quincy Jones knows better. I don't talk about it, no way."" He's defending the supposed fact that Michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized ""he's a JACKSON"". After MJ's death, Joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile Smokey Robinson went on the Larry King show and praised MJ as an artist.
This theory explains why Michael not only looks like Diana Ross and has the same features and eyes as her, but also explains why his facial structure looks like Smokey's & their profiles and ears are completely identical, and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (Diana, Smokey & Michael are the only three musicians besides the Beatles who have two stars each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both Smokey and Diana (and Evan Ross!) have in common. Here you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like Ross eyes. Now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. It's why he acted like an orphan and called himself Peter Pan and built Neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. It absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. And it explains why Diana Ross is second to Katherine Jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why Joe Jackson has been known to dislike Diana Ross. At Michael Jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is Smokey Robinson reading a letter from Diana Ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that Michael was ""part of the fabric of her life"". When Smokey speaks about MJ later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. In the movie Hitsville USA: The Making of Motown, Berry Gordy jokes with Smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his & that MJ reminded him of a little Smokey. Also, the movie An American Dream was about the Jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. 
So, it wasn't that Michael was ever trying to look like Diana Ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he INHERITED from her. In one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. Now you might say well Janet looks a lot like MJ, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like Latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. Joe and Berry branded and marketed the Jacksons a certain way to make Michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to Michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). MJ has much more defined features and is rail thin like Diana Ross, and his nose & chin match Smokey's. Now it's clear why Joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.

fjcbjiu,Link a peer reviewed journal for these claims please.,"There is a great deal of research done on the efficacy of homeopathy, and you can google some meta studies on the subject. From my experience, (and the studies support this), homeopathy works on several ailments that main stream medicine has difficulty in treating, like respiratory diseases such as asthma, especially in children. It also has shown to be effective in reducing discomfort and pain from the side effects of cancer treatments like chemo, removal of warts without surgery, etc. 
The problem occurs when some homeopaths make outlandish claims on its cures. Homeopathy has its place in treating several chronic problems, but if people start believing it can cure cancers and the like, then they will run into major problems. So look at homeopathy as an effective alternative to some ailments that cause discomfort which main stream medicine cannot cure. But looking at it as an effective and complete alternative to allopathy will mean one will do so at one’s own peril. However, there is always the problem of finding an experienced and effective homeopath, since so many of them are just not upto the mark.",0

English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70).

I've no idea how An Post got that letter to me.,"Unfortunately, while Bus Éireann and Iarnróid Éireann accept the Student Leap Card as proof of your student status, Dublin Bus, Luas, Dart and Commuter only accept it.
An Post are usually very good at getting things to the correct person. If you're at 50 Fitzwilliam Street and they send it to 15 Witzfillian Road, I'd say it'll get to you.
There's not much that they can do to trace you, but if the same inspector catches you again, he might call the guards. If you're found guilty in the District Court of deliberately evading your fare (and while the inspector has accepted you acted in error, rather than fraudulently, by purchasing a student ticket you weren't entitled to and gave you a Standard Fare Notice instead of prosecuting; if you've given him a false name and address that is an attempt to evade your fare) you face a fine of up to €1000 plus costs.
What is the reason code on your notice? 
If you appeal it right away it's frozen at the lower rate of €45 instead of going up to €100 (if not paid in 28 days) until the decision is made, so if nothing else this will allow you some time to get the money together.",0

fj9hvdb,"Nobody gives a fuck about Irish peacekeeping except for our local military fetishists. If your only argument for Ireland having an army is that they can back up front line civil services in an emergency then its already over. Just expand the civil defence and let the guards deal with the IRA as they have done fairly successfully since the beginning of the state.
The only real reason to have an army is to wage war, and ireland would need at least 20 times the current army to survive a determined invasion by any realistic OPFOR for more than a few days, so why bother? A standing army in Ireland just makes it easier for the (non-existant) invasion force to kill our men. 
&#x200B;
Do an Iceland and get rid of it all I'd say, keep a few tanks and guns around for the children and the re-eanctors to ooh and ah over.","A lot of people are saying this is good without any real understanding of what's going on here. We shouldn't be so naive as to think that the lower the better because war is bad.
First of all, defence forces aren't just for fighting other militaries. They're responsible for a wide variety of tasks. They're the last line of defence in cases of armed violence. That has a few different meanings, but one of the main ones is terrorism.
Obviously Islamic terrorism has never been a problem here, but Northern Ireland has had more terrorist attacks than any other region in Europe. The defence forces are the main reason why that violence didn't spill across the border. They were posted along the border in strength and had to repel multiple attempts by the IRA to set up on our side of the border.
Also, in times of emergency, be it from extreme weather or pandemics, the defence forces can also be deployed to fulfil a broad range of roles.
They also fill in for emergency services when people such as prison guards or paramedics go on strike.
And lastly, they're generally regarded as among the best peacekeepers in the world. Ireland is a country that punches above our weight in terms of soft power and our commitment to peacekeeping is a huge part of that. The value of the soft power from peacekeeping vastly outweighs its costs.
These are all essential services that we all take for granted. However, with expenditure at 0.3% of GDP, the defence forces are critically underfunded, which has left them in a crisis. Members are not getting fair pay and they're struggling to carry out their duties. With extreme weather and covid19 on our doorstep, we may find that the defence forces are not in the position to fulfil their emergency roles.
We can still have among the lowest expenditure in the EU and increase funding to ease all of these problems.",0

fj9oz6g,"> Sanjeev Bhaskar
Huh, I always wondered if it was a deliberate reference:
When talking about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the British Book Awards, Sanjeev Bhaskar stated that he chose 42 as the house number because in the Hitchhiker's series 42 features prominently as the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.","The book is what got me into reading, [I mean I could read, but was 'too cool' for it as a teen], when I was about 15. 
Saw a program about top 100 books, where actors introducted a book/acted some of it out, and hitchhikers was presented by 
Sanjeev Bhaskar. He acted out some of stuff about the computer giving the ""42"" answer and I found it hilarious. Read the book, then the next one.......and the other 3 as well. Loved every single page of them. 
Since then, these books have spun me off into reading anything/everything I can get my hands on. So thank you Douglas Adams and Sanjeev for bringing this to my attention some 16+ years ago.",0

DoN't pANiC.","Christ on a crumpet. People are whipping themselves up into a completely unecessary panic about this thing, OP included. Go about your normal business.  Here is the advice of the World Health Organisation:
>>RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is
spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. It’s a good idea to get the facts from reliable sources to help you 
accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (See Frequently Asked Questions). 
We are currently low risk.  We have 25 cases, nine of which are citizens we brought home from the Diamond Princess, and fifteen of which have already recovered. While highly contagious, the illness is mild for the vast majority of people who get it, including young children who usually have higher mortality rates from flu-like illnesses.  Our health system has demonstrated that it is adept at catching and contact tracing cases, public awareness is high and people who are concerned they have been exposed have been exemplary in undertaking self-isolation.

Placed back into Newstart I was apparently in the 'work for the dole phase' where I had on my file that ""Essential Skills for Work"" was a course that is mandatory to complete. 2 weeks, 9 till 2 of the most transparent cash grab of a course I have ever seen.  
English is broken at best, most multiple choices don't actually have correct values in them (i.e one wanted to calculate 15 hours of pay at $17.50 an hour, but had 5 choices all under $70). I am currently trying to complete a supplementary course in Python, specifically ML, and was going to use my free time during the day to jobsearch...  
Mandatory. 5 hours a day for 2 weeks. I have to sit in this popup office and cannot complete it in my own time at my home computer. Doing this blatant government supplement cash grab that we're all paying for.  
None of the people who 'work' in the office actually have anything to do with the course; all they do is schedule and mark you off as attended. LP Pathways is the name of the provider of this gem.  
Edit: Bonus image. Parts of the course that require supervision are just ignored as that would be a waste of profit.
